AB  - In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This is followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed.

AB  - Water scarcity invariably poses a threat to the sustainability of cities and rural areas with limited resources, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a new hydro-economic model based on system dynamics and agent-based simulation to enhance the sustainability of urban groundwater. Dynamic pricing was performed based on several parameters, such as resource conditions, price elasticity, consumption history and climate change, to improve the sustainability of groundwater and cover the costs of implementing strategies. Different scenarios based on pricing, rationing, culturalizing, and non-revenue water control strategies were applied in the village of Dehno in Yazd Province as the case study with an arid climate. The results showed that several scenarios can achieve the goal, but, in drought conditions, only a combination of all the strategies will work.

AB  - The economy as a whole and most of its constituent parts, like markets, government institutions, firms, or households, are inherently complex conceptual constructions. Micro-level diversity, decentralized interaction, self-organization, adaptation and learning, emergence, and evolution, are some of the fundamental features that the above entities share and that allow to classify them as being complex entities. In a complex economic system, existing structures of interaction are in constant mutation as individual agents contact and influence one another and, by doing so, reshape the macro environment in which socio-economic relations unfold. Notwithstanding the observed pervasiveness of complexity in economics, there are a few areas of economic thought where the discussion on the theme has gained an exceptional relevance. In this article, six of such areas are identified and their complex nature is highlighted and scrutinized. These pertain to: (i) Knowledge interactions and technological innovation; (ii) Corporate design and organizational learning; (iii) Public policies directed at market regulation; (iv) Banking and financial markets; (v) Environmental economics, sustainability, and climate change; and (vi) income inequality.

AB  - In the context of sustainable development, complex adaptive systems frameworks can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraint and opportunity with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner's Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then create a new human and nature dynamics agent based model to explore technological progression on population dynamics, economic development, social inequality and use of resources. We investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and societal sustainability. Our initial result shows complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all scales of human behavior and dynamics.

AB  - The assessment of the socio-economic and financial impacts of climate change represents a main source of uncertainty for policy makers and investors. However, traditional climate economics and financial risk models are not properly equipped to consider the characteristics of climate risks and the opportunities from climate-alignment, being constrained by equilibrium conditions and linearity of impacts, as well as by representative agents and intertemporal optimization. Given the closing window of opportunity to achieve the 2 degrees C target, there is an urgent need for a new wave of models able to embrace uncertainty and complexity deriving not only from climate impacts on socio-economic systems, but also from their reaction. In this regard, approaches rooted on evolutionary economics and complexity science could provide complementary insights to traditional climate economics models. This special issue contributes to fill in this knowledge gap by collecting nine papers applying evolutionary and complex systems approaches, and agent-based and network models to climate change economics, presented at the Special Session of the Research Area "Environment-Economics Interactions" of the European Association of Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE)'s conference 2016. By introducing conceptual and methodological innovations in climate economics and finance, the nine articles analyse the conditions for effective climate policies and financial instruments to align countries to the global climate targets, compared to the costs of inaction. This information is crucial to support decision-makers in the analysis of climate-finance policies and instruments to foster the transition to a sustainable and inclusive low-carbon economy.

AB  - As access to water is a right of all people, government agents are responsible to allocate water to guarantee its sustainable use for multiple users. However, deciding the best allocation strategy is not a straightforward task. In complex systems, which depend on a collection of individual decisions by people, water policies may have unpredictable impacts. Considering the water allocation in a water canal, we present an agent-based model that allocates water and incorporates an agents' adaptability behaviour strategy of overriding the manager's decision when water right is denied. We compared scenarios of farmers' override susceptibility and of water availability on the Canal do Sertao in the state of Alagoas, northeastern Brazil. In the scenario of reduced water capacity, agents with water rights in the last segments of the canal were unable to withdraw water due to agents who withdrew illegally. The sustainability of the system proved to be sensitive to the level of susceptibility of capturing water illegally, deserving attention and investments in the oversight sector. Besides this effect, the model can be applied to assess and compare advantages and impacts on the water levels for different water policies such as financial subsidies or different water allocation strategies.

AB  - During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social-ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social-ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social-ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy.

AB  - This paper focuses on the use of system thinking, complex adaptive systems theory and modeling to help create and operate sustainable energy infrastructure. These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given.

AB  - This research examines how energy efficiency measures impact macroeconomic results and solves an important research deficiency. An analysis of how energy efficiency policies impact macroeconomic dynamics occurs through agent-based modeling (ABM). This research evaluates two approaches to sustainable economic development by studying tax incentives as indirect measures and public research laboratory R&D investments as direct measures. The implemented research and development-focused energy efficiency policies create superior environmental benefits while preserving economic stability, according to research results. The study demonstrates why carefully planned government policies are essential for sustainable ecological development and economic stability. The research data provides crucial knowledge for government officials who need practical guidance for merging energy efficiency strategies into economic planning systems. This research expands knowledge about energy efficiency relationships between the environment and the economy while offering directions for additional study on the multiple connections between energy use and economic stability and environmental objectives.

AB  - Public agencies make significant investments in capital facilities to meet the requirements of their missions. Interest in sustainable building practices has increased over recent years, but obstacles remain to implementing such practices in public construction projects on a regular basis. A primary stumbling block is the difficulty in generating accurate estimates for total cost of ownership of a facility in the early stages of design. This paper builds on previously published work to describe the prototype implementation of an agent based model to help determine the inputs for cost modeling.

AB  - This paper outlines a synthesis of ecological economics with econophysics and other complexity approaches to economics. Arguably, the resulting "ecological econophysics" will be scientifically sounder than mainstream economics and much better suited to addressing a major challenge of our times: the development of democratically-based policies to reduce economic throughput to an environmentally sustainable level without triggering economic crises and without excluding part of the world's population, i.e., to implement degrowth. Degrowth will need major structural changes, which leads us to question whether there are limits to the malleability of the economic system's architecture. A fundamental limit will be encountered if, as suggested by the physics of complexity, long-lasting complex systems always occur midway between an ordered and a disordered state. There is much evidence that this hypothesis holds and that the current economic system satisfies this condition. However, this does not mean that the problems posed by this system should be unavoidable. Ecological econophysics gives clues to identifying alternative economic systems that would also function between order and chaos, but which would have radically different implications for environmental sustainability and social justice.

AB  - Models of human dimensions of fisheries are important to understanding and predicting how fishing industries respond to changes in marine ecosystems and management institutions. Advances in computation have made it possible to construct agent-based models (ABMs)-which explicitly describe the behaviour of individual people, firms or vessels in order to understand and predict their aggregate behaviours. ABMs are widely used for both academic and applied purposes in many settings including finance, urban planning and the military, but are not yet mainstream in fisheries science and management, despite a growing literature. ABMs are well suited to understanding emergent consequences of fisher interactions, heterogeneity and bounded rationality, especially in complex ecological, social and institutional contexts. For these reasons, we argue that ABMs of human behaviour can contribute significantly to human dimensions of fisheries in three areas: (a) understanding interactions between multiple management institutions; (b) incorporating cognitive and behavioural sciences into fisheries science and practice; and (c) understanding and projecting the social consequences of management institutions. We provide simple examples illustrating the potential for ABMs in each of these areas, using conceptual ("toy") versions of the POSEIDON model. We argue that salient strategic advances in these areas could pave the way for increased tactical use of ABMs in fishery management settings. We review common ABM development and application challenges, with the aim of providing guidance to beginning ABM developers and users studying human dimensions of fisheries.

AB  - Bicycling can improve the sustainability and liveability of cities, many of which desperately require better active transport infrastructure. Urban and transport planners need to examine how improvements in infrastructure change bicyclists' behaviour. With this knowledge, investment in bicycling networks can be more efficient and encourage the use of bicycling for transportation. This study developed a simple Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate bicyclists' movements in response to the built environment and road network characteristics in the City of Penrith, in the Greater Sydney Area, Australia. In this case study, the GAMA platform was used to build the ABM and Strava and Riderlog data were used to calibrate and validate the model. The model outputs give in-sights into bicyclist movements through the road network. The incorporated built environment characteristics include the type of bicycling infrastructure, tree canopy, slope, land use mix, and vehicle traffic. These choice factors also allowed the computation of rider levels of comfort and safety on each trip. Potential refinements of the model include additional bicycling behaviour factors (such as aesthetic preferences), and bicyclists' interactions with each other and other modes of transport.

AB  - In the evolving landscape of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, the quest for decentralized governance has led to the advent of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs offer a groundbreaking framework where token holders directly influence the management and strategic direction of decentralized structures. This study delves into the concept of DAO through the lens of No1s1, an experimental project embodying a self-sustaining architecture governed autonomously. No1s1 stands out as a physical space that operates independently, rewarding participants with tokens for performing maintenance tasks crucial for its upkeep. In this contribution, we employ agent-based modelling to simulate interactions between participants and No1s1, exploring the dynamics of the token economy, participatory governance, and the sustainability of such an autonomous entity. By examining the reciprocal maintenance relationship and its impact on No1s1's longevity and wealth, this study sheds light on the potential and challenges of DAO-governed structures.

AB  - To develop more sustainable industrial systems industrialists and policy makers need to better understand how to respond to economic, environmental, and social challenges and transform industrial behaviour by leveraging appropriate industrial technology investments to reshape the current manufacturing value chain. Investments have to be collected on the private as well as public sides taking into account the stakeholders' macro-economic framework. Since aggregate mathematical models, assuming informed, rational behaviour leading to equilibrium conditions cannot catch the resulting complexity, an agent-based modelling and simulation approach is proposed to investigate policies to support investments in resource efficiency. The EURACE agent-based framework has been adopted and modified by coupling the environmental sector with other established macroeconomic dimensions. The findings of this research establish the potential and capability of the proposed approach for investigating policies for sustainability transition analysis and evaluation.

AB  - Understanding complex (social) phenomena benefits from combining different tools, perspectives, expertise, and experiences. Research designs that combine approaches are gaining in popularity. Carrying out research in interdisciplinary teams, however, is a challenging, high-investment activity. Unawareness of and reflecting on conflicting ways of seeing or studying the world may endanger project success. Agent-based modelling has proven instrumental in bringing together different approaches. Yet, this potential enabler remains an unusual combination partner: the additional prevalent lack of transparency about what is combined, and how, obstructs advancement. We therefore invite our readers behind the scenes of our multi-year research collaboration where we combine agent-based modelling with controlled behavioural experiments to advance the understanding of collective resource use in a common pool resource dilemma. The paper contributes by 1) being an example in sharing the processes of combining approaches, and by 2) highlighting the enabling role of ABM in combining research approaches.

AB  - The broadening spectrum of environmental problems, the uncertainty regarding their scale and duration, and their possible irreversibility, in the context of the growing social preference for environmental quality, make it necessary to undertake an ex ante approach to the link between productive activity and environmental quality. This link lies in technology, and the right approach is to understand how the process of technological change can lead towards sustainability. The added value of Evolutionary Economics in the context of environmental policy resides mainly in the fact that it warns that certain inferior environmental technologies may be locked in to the economic system. The results of our model show that it would be advisable to undertake policies expressly aimed at the process of sustainable technological change-applying an ex ante (precautionary) approach-in a way that is complementary to the conventional equilibrium oriented environmental policies. The nature of these policies and how they might be implemented are questions we will address from this novel approach to the concept of sustainable development. In short, the main objectives of this paper are to understand more fully the dynamics of the process of technological change, its role in sustainable development, and to assess the implications of this dynamic approach to techno-environmental policy. To achieve these goals we have developed an agent-based model (ABM), using distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concepts drawn from the general methodology of social simulation.

AB  - Sustainability outcomes are influenced by the laws and configurations of natural and engineered systems as well as activities in socio- economic systems. An important subset of human activity is the creation and implementation of institutions, formal and informal rules shaping a wide range of human behavior. Understanding these rules and codifying them in computational models can provide important missing insights into why systems function the way they do (static) as well as the pace and structure of transitions required to improve sustainability (dynamic). Here, we con-duct a comparative synthesis of three modeling approaches- integrated assessment modeling, engineering-economic optimization, and agent- based modeling-with underexplored potential to represent institutions. We first perform modeling experi-ments on climate mitigation systems that represent specific aspects of heterogeneous institutions, including formal policies and institutional coordination, and informal attitudes and norms. We find measurable but uneven aggregate impacts, while more politically meaningful distributional impacts are large across various actors. Our results show that omitting institutions can influence the costs of climate mitigation and miss opportunities to leverage institutional forces to speed up emissions reduc-tion. These experiments allow us to explore the capacity of each modeling approach to represent insitutions and to lay out a vision for the next frontier of endogenizing institutional change in sustainability science models. To bridge the gap between mod-eling, theories, and empirical evidence on social institutions, this research agenda calls for joint efforts between sustainability modelers who wish to explore and incorporate institutional detail, and social scientists studying the socio- political and economic foundations for sustainability transitions.

AB  - When rainfall does not meet crop water requirements, supplemental irrigation is needed to maintain productivity. On-farm ponds can prevent excessive groundwater exploitation - to the benefit of the whole community - but they reduce the cultivated area and require investments by each farmer. Thus, choosing the source of water for irrigation (groundwatervson-farm pond) is a problem of collective action. An agent-based model is developed to simulate a smallholder farming system; the farmers' long-/short-view orientation determines the choice of the water source. We identify the most beneficial water source for economic gain and its stability, and how it can change across communities and under future climate scenarios. By using on-farm ponds, long-view-oriented farmers provide collective advantages but have individual advantages only under extreme climates; a tragedy of the commons is always possible. Changes in farmers' attitudes (and hence sources of water) based on previous experiences can worsen the economic outcome.

AB  - Background: Sustaining evidence-based interventions (EBIs) is an ongoing challenge for dissemination and implementation science in public health and social services. Characterizing the relationship among human resource capacity within an agency and subsequent population outcomes is an important step to improving our understanding of how EBIs are sustained. Although human resource capacity and population outcomes are theoretically related, examining them over time within real-world experiments is difficult. Simulation approaches, especially agent-based models, offer advantages that complement existing methods.
   Methods: We used an agent-based model to examine the relationships among human resources, EBI delivery, and population outcomes by simulating provision of an EBI through a hypothetical agency and its staff. We used data from existing studies examining a widely implemented HIV prevention intervention to inform simulation design, calibration, and validity. Once we developed a baseline model, we used the model as a simulated laboratory by systematically varying three human resource variables: the number of staff positions, the staff turnover rate, and timing in training. We tracked the subsequent influence on EBI delivery and the level of population risk over time to describe the overall and dynamic relationships among these variables.
   Results: Higher overall levels of human resource capacity at an agency (more positions) led to more extensive EBI delivery over time and lowered population risk earlier in time. In simulations representing the typical human resource investments, substantial influences on population risk were visible after approximately 2 years and peaked around 4 years.
   Conclusions: Human resources, especially staff positions, have an important impact on EBI sustainability and ultimately population health. A minimum level of human resources based on the context (e.g., size of the initial population and characteristics of the EBI) is likely needed for an EBI to have a meaningful impact on population outcomes. Furthermore, this model demonstrates how ABMs may be leveraged to inform research design and assess the impact of EBI sustainability in practice.

AB  - This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation.

AB  - South Africa's land redistribution aims to redress the historical injustices of apartheid. This paper evaluates the efficacy of an agent-based model to support and refine the process. Using the Impacts of Land Use Patterns in South Africa model, developed from surveys of 658 commercial farmers and 833 commercially oriented smallholders, we simulate three scenarios: the current willing seller, willing buyer mechanism as our baseline, a second scenario that includes land subdivision to produce emerging farm parcels, and a third scenario that includes expropriation of underperforming farms. We find that the current mechanism is likely to redistribute only 14% of the targeted 30% of commercial farmland. Including land subdivision increases the number of beneficiary farms from 4,383 to 73,600, improving access to land but reducing farm sizes and thus possibly economic sustainability. Including expropriation adds about 2.4 million hectares, mainly for grazing, with a small allocation for field crops and horticulture. All three scenarios could reduce production volumes, with marked differences in impact across agricultural subsectors in the subdivision scenario. Realising these scenarios over an eight-year period is projected to require substantial financial investment, with estimated costs ranging from R422 billion to R626.9 billion, heavily weighted towards operational capital to maintain farm productivity and viability. The study demonstrates the model's value for policymakers, enabling them to explore and evaluate the outcomes of different land redistribution strategies, ensuring more informed and effective policy-making.

AB  - This paper discusses a method for the identification of leverage points for the transformation of complex economic systems by combining value chain analysis and a relational perspective on markets. We introduce the Network of Markets Approach and show that it is central in bridging the two concepts and apply social network analysis in order to do so. The case of the German bioeconomy, the transition from a fossil to a bio-based economy, is chosen to exemplify the application of the method. Here, we provide the specific rationales behind our approach and identify possible key markets for governance interventions in the transformation toward a bio-based economy in Germany.

AB  - Across contemporary and historical human groups, there is variation in how cultures interact with the environment and this variation is inherited through culture. Some human-environment relationships maximize group fitness relative to other relationships. Thus, there is heritable, fitness-associated variation in human-environment interactions and so human-environment interactions may be understood to be an evolved trait. However, one fitness-maximizing human-environment relationship could be unsustainable resource extraction. Anthroecological theory proposes that human cultures and genotypes have been selected for unsustainability, although several mechanisms have been proposed for how this selection may have worked. Here, I extend anthroecological theory and argue that energy inheritances are critical to understanding the evolution of human unsustainability and the human-environment relationship. I develop an agent-based model to illustrate the hypotheses and find that the ability to pass energy to successive generations has impacts on sustainability. Simulations in which energy cannot be passed to subsequent generations are more stable and sustainable than those that can pass energy to offspring, but simulations in which energy cannot be inherited evolve higher reproductive rates than those with energy inheritance. A significant loss of diversity occurs in the simulations and I tentatively compare this loss to the cultural hegemony associated with historic colonization.

AB  - By drawing analogies with independent research areas, we propose an unorthodox framework for mapping microfinance credit risk-a major obstacle to the sustainability of lenders outreaching to the poor. Specifically, using the elements of network theory, we constructed an agent-based model that obeys the stylized rules of microfinance industry. We found that in a deteriorating economic environment confounded with adverse selection, a form of latent moral hazard may cause a regime shift from a high to a low loan payment probability. An after-the-fact recovery, when possible, required the economic environment to improve beyond that which led to the shift in the first place. These findings suggest a small set of measurable quantities for mapping microfinance credit risk and, consequently, for balancing the requirements to reasonably price loans and to operate on a fully self-financed basis. We illustrate how the proposed mapping works using a 10-year monthly data set from one of the best-known microfinance representatives, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Finally, we discuss an entirely new perspective for managing microfinance credit risk based on enticing spontaneous cooperation by building social capital.

AB  - Energy efficiency can help facing the climate crises. Yet the energy intensity has decreased more slowly than required to achieve climate goals. Based on this premise, we build an agent-based model to study the effects of different energy efficiency policies. Policies analysed range from indirect policies - taxes, incentives, and subsidies - to direct technological policies, where a public research laboratory invests in R&D to establish a new technological energy efficiency paradigm. Results reveal that, although most of the policies effectively reduce energy intensity, the research lab is the most efficient in promoting energy efficiency without negative impacts on macroeconomic and public finance conditions. However, the success of this policy requires a long-term commitment, highlighting the importance of complementing this strategy with more "ready to use"measures. The findings also indicate that most policies do not induce significant macroeconomic rebound effects. Concerns about macroeconomic rebound effects may likely be overstated.

AB  - The eco-economic system is a complex system based on human activities, and the sustainability of the eco-economic system needs to maintain the balance between the three subsystems of society, economy, and environment. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation index system of the ecological-economic system of Liaoning Province in China was constructed by combining the emergy analysis and the system dynamic (SD) model, and four development scenarios were designed by adjusting the influencing factors of the ecological-economic system, based on the simulation and evaluation of the sustainable ecological and economic development of Liaoning Province from 2017 through to the next 19 years. The conclusion shows that, under the scenario of coordinated development type, the GDP, emergy density, and emergy output rate of Liaoning Province show an increasing trend; the ecological load, such as waste emergy ratio and environmental load rate, is small; and the sustainable development index and emergy sustainable development index are at a high level compared to other programs.

AB  - As electricity systems evolve, accurately modeling consumer behavior is crucial for policy design and system planning. This study examines how different approaches to initializing consumer agents in electricity market simulations impact sustainability outcomes. We compare three strategies: (1) aggregate public data distributions, (2) aggregate survey data distributions, and (3) individual-level survey data from 839 respondents. Using New Jersey's electricity market as a case study, we simulate household decisions on solar investments, clean-energy participation, and consumption over 40 years (2010-2050) with an agent-based model, running 500 Monte Carlo simulations per approach, validated against 2010-2020 historical data. Results reveal important trade-offs between modeling approaches. Aggregate public data models most accurately track historical consumption and energy burden, while survey-based models, particularly individual-level, predict higher renewable adoption and program participation rates. The individual survey methodology captures greater behavioral heterogeneity and socioeconomic disparities, revealing potential energy justice concerns that remain hidden in aggregate models. Despite these differences, all approaches maintain comparable accuracy in predicting system-level metrics like total electricity consumption. These findings demonstrate that modeling outcomes are very sensitive to initialization highlighting the importance of aligning model design with the intended research question and available data.

AB  - The theoretical framework and methodology of a water ecological-economic system (WEES) assessment based on emergy synthesis are proposed in this paper. Through calculating ecological and economic inputs and outputs within and outside the complex system, this paper discusses the system's economic situation, water resources development and system sustainability based on a series of emergy indicators. Besides traditional indices, following the principle of system assessment, four new indices, water emergy ratio (WER), water emergy utilization ratio (WEUR), water emergy self-support ratio (WESR), and water emergy density (WED) are formulated to assess the state of water resources development quantitatively. Taking the Zhengzhou water ecological-economic system as a study area, through the comparison of the systematic indicators of Zhengzhou with those of the selected Chinese cities, the general status of the Zhengzhou water ecological-economic system in China is identified. The results also show that most indicators of Beijing are located at middle levels among the selected Chinese cities. In particular, the sustainability, expressed by the indicators emergy-based sustainability index (ESI) and water resources population carrying capacity (WPC) were 1.34 and 1.94 million, respectively, in Zhengzhou in 2005, which indicates that the Zhengzhou WEES is in heavy pressure of water resources and is located at low levels of sustainability.

AB  - This article proposes an agent-based model to support the development of self-sustaining regional innovation systems (RIS). The model is the base of a computational laboratory, CARIS (Complex Adaptive Regional Innovation System), which aims at evaluating the self-sustainability of RIS and at investigating what are the resources, competencies and mechanisms able to trigger powerful innovation and economic growth processes. Such a topic is particularly interesting for the so-called lagging regions, which, notwithstanding noticeable policy interventions, have been unable to significantly improve their innovation performances. Results of this study show that the exploration capacity, the propensity to cooperation, and the endowed competencies of actors belonging to a region could be considered as key aspects in affecting the regional innovation performance. This means that policy-makers should (i) incentivize investments in research and development activities both at the public and private levels; (ii) support public-private partnerships; (iii) enhance national and regional university systems; and (iv) increase the number of researchers employed both in the public and private sectors. In the next future, the CARIS laboratory could be adopted as policy support instrument to evaluate how much effective are current innovation policies and what are the most effective ones to reassess the current patterns.

AB  - The sustainability of the ongoing Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures. This study uses an empirically based, agent-based model to explore the effect of six scenarios on both area of land covered by, as well as the quality of SWC structures in three Kebeles (villages) of Boset District. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple interventions enhanced SWC most in all Kebeles. Furthermore, increasing the commitment of local government through capacity building generated most effect and yet required the lowest investment. Motivating farmers, introducing alternative livelihood opportunities and establishing and strengthening micro-watershed associations had limited, but differential influence on the outcomes across the Kebeles. However, all alternative scenarios had some added value compared to doing business as usual. Hence, in order to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of the ongoing CBWM program in the study area and other similar localities, it is crucial to pay much more attention to increasing the commitment of local government actors through capacity building. This empowers local government actors to (1) plan and more efficiently implement the program in consultation with other local actors, and (2) integrate locally sensitive need-based adaptation of the program.

AB  - Decisions on capital intensive hydrological infrastructure, including dams and canal-fed irrigation schemes, may have non-trivial effects on the behaviour and, ultimately, the well-being of local communities. We propose an interdisciplinary agent-based model to deepen the understanding of the impact of hydropower infrastructure investment on the water-energy-food nexus of local rural communities, focusing on food security in the context of a moderately sized hydropower and irrigation development in a developing country. The paper explicitly formalises the decision processes and the interactions between rural villages, districts and national governments in hierarchical and peer-to-peer networks. The findings capture the consequences of the arising competition for water and land between new dam construction and local agricultural production. Results demonstrate that these dynamics can be further exacerbated by demographic pressures and climate change, leading to unsustainable consumption levels. However, these effects could be mitigated by prevention-oriented governmental policies such as investments in best practices and technological innovation, or by updating diet preferences, such increasing the consumption of food commodities with more efficient production.

AB  - Energy conservation in residential buildings has been a topic of interest in recent years because of their high levels of energy consumption. Weatherization is set of approaches that can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient, thereby helping residents lower their energy bills and improving environmental sustainability. However, there are two significant challenges associated with weatherization adoption: high upfront investment costs with a long payback period, and minimal awareness of weatherization and its benefits. This paper proposes an agent-based model that will allow researchers to explore residents' socially-motivated energy conservation decisions by providing a realistic social context via a multilayer social network and incorporating opinion dynamics based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemic model. Several experimental scenarios are run to demonstrate the model's potential to help policymakers determine how to encourage residential weatherization adoption.

AB  - Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk (SR), the risk that a major fraction of the system ceases to function, and collapses. It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed 'Systemic Risk Tax' (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR.

AB  - Full decarbonisation of the electricity system is one of the key elements to limit global warming. As this transition takes place, the electricity system must maintain system adequacy and remain affordable to consumers. In liberalised electricity markets investors are seen as key actors driving this transition.
   Due to the intermittent character of renewable assets, such as wind or solar parks, electricity systems with large shares of renewable electricity will need to become increasingly flexible. Evaluating whether specific market designs provide the right incentives to invest in flexibility, requires the simulation of realistic investor behaviour. Agent-based modelling provides the means to explore heterogeneous, imperfectly informed and boundedly rational investor behaviour within different electricity market designs.
   We evaluated two market designs; "energy-only" markets and markets with a Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM). We conclude that energy-only markets, even with strong carbon pricing, do not incentivise investors to deliver a fully renewable, reliable and affordable energy system. Therefore policy makers should focus on developing CRMs which can work in combination with market incentives to reach a fully renewable, reliable and affordable electricity system in the second half of this century.

AB  - A debt-based economy requires the accumulation of more and more debt to finance economic growth, while future economic growth is needed to repay the debt, and so the cycle continues. Despite global debt reaching unprecedented levels, little research has been done to understand the impacts of debt dynamics on environmental sustainability. Here, we explore the environmental impacts of the debt-growth cycle in Indonesia, the world's largest debt-based producer of palm oil. Our empirical Agent-Based Model analyses the future effects (2018-2050) of power (im)balance scenarios between debt-driven economic forces (i.e. banks, firms), and conservation forces, on two ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation) and biodiversity. The model shows the trade-offs and synergies among these indicators for Business As Usual as compared to alternative scenarios. Results show that debt-driven economic forces can partially support environmental conservation, provided the state's role in protecting the environment is reinforced. Our analysis provides a lesson for developing countries that are highly dependent on debt-based production systems: sustainable development pathways can be achievable in the short and medium terms; however, reaching long-term sustainability requires reduced dependency on external financial powers, as well as further government intervention to protect the environment from the rough edges of the market economy.

AB  - Irrigation systems contribute worldwide to the provision of a wide range of services on which the survival and well-being of humanity depend. They are of primary importance in Vietnam where about 90% of the water used is for irrigation and aquaculture and where agriculture is the largest employer and a major contributor to the national GDP and to the income of the low-salary households. Nevertheless, irrigation systems have recently been subjected to several issues including increasing demand, pollution, under-investment, depletion of resources or environmental changes. Any mitigation measure against these issues needs to be sustainable with respect to the very diverse uses of the water, the changing conditions upstream and downstream, and the somewhat conflicting objectives carried out by landuse/agricultural planning on one hand and urbanization and society well-being on the other. This need of sustainability requires the design of innovative tools to tackle these issues. This work aims at exploring the usage of Agent-Based Modelling coupled with a tangible and interactive interface in order to enhance interactions between stakeholders and support the evaluation of various alternatives of the management of the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system.

AB  - In the dynamic landscape of technological advancements, the Digital Twin is emerging as a powerful aid with the potential to transform traditional decision-making approaches for diverse complex systems. Technically, it offers a paradigm shift in our understanding and resolution of intricate problems by effectively mirroring real-world entities. This enables us to comprehend their behaviors through simulation, anticipate anomalies for outlier environmental conditions, and derive evidence-driven solutions. While proven effective in physical and cyber-physical systems, its untapped potential lies in the realm of techno-socio-economic systems that operate in dynamic and uncertain environments.
   The use of such technology in informed decision-making is significant for enterprises and society, as modern businesses and societal structures demand innovative solutions that transcend conventional approaches. With the growing need, the global digital twin market is expected to expand from $11.51 billion in 2023 to $137.67 billion by 2030, impacting domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, sustainability, smart cities, and more. However, realizing this vast business potential hinges on advancing technological capabilities and fostering innovation. This workshop aims to discuss the existing landscape of digital twins and explore uncharted territory by harnessing the latent potential of Digital Twins within techno-socio-economic systems.

AB  - Livestock systems contribution to environmental change is controversial. Pasture-based systems are considered a sustainable alternative due to their adaptation to the use of local natural resources. However, they have limited productivity per product unit and, in Europe, depend on public economic support. Furthermore, they are heterogeneous in farm structure and resources use, which may determine their sustainability. We use emergy accounting to assess the sustainability of mountain pasture-based cattle systems and analyse the variability among farms. Emergy accounting assesses the sustainability performance of complex systems (i.e., farming systems) and their interaction with other systems (i.e., the environment and the socio-economic system) focusing on the origin, quality and quantity of the energy required for the system to function. Results show that pasture-based systems largely use local natural renewable resources but depend largely on the wider socio-economic system given their reliance on public economic support and purchased animal feeds. This economic dependence turns out in most farms largely using non-renewable resources. Increasing self-produced feeds and grazing on natural pastures can reduce the dependence on the socio-economic system and improve farm sustainability.

AB  - China is making great efforts to build an ecological civilization. To reveal the effectiveness and spatial characteristics of the ecological civilization development in China, we constructed an Ecological Civilization Evaluation Index (ECI) based on the economic-social-natural complex system. We evaluated the development level of the ecological civilization in China from 2004 to 2020 and discussed the coupling and coordination relationship between subsystems. We found that the ecological civilization of China has achieved remarkable results. The relationship among the three subsystems has been improved to some extent, but the high-quality development of the economic system still requires effort. The development level of the ecological civilization in China presents spatial heterogeneity. From east to west, 30 provinces can be classified into four different types of development. On the whole, the development of China's ecological civilization has provided experiences for the world.

AB  - In the contemporary context of an acute need for sustainability and swift response to imminent crises such as global warming, pandemics and economic system disruptions, the focus on responsible decision making, ethical risk assessment and mitigation at all organizational levels is an overarching goal. Our aim is to introduce a deterministic method for investigating the stability of complex systems, in order to find the most important elements of such systems and their impact on different scenarios. The novelty of the current approach lies in its compact format and intuitive nature, designed to accommodate a limited amount of computational resources. The proposed modelling method involves the mapping of complex systems from a diversity of disciplines (economic markets, resource management domain and the community impact of suburbanisation) onto a sequence of chemical reactions and involving a subsequent mathematical analysis. Mapping the results back onto the use cases shows that one can retrieve a considerable amount of detail, making the modelling strategy general enough to be adaptable and scalable while also detailed enough to provide valuable insights for practical scenarios.

AB  - Indonesia has reevaluated its archipelagic logistics system to implement a strategic shift from a point-to-point network to a hub-and-spoke network, with a plan to establish seven new regional distribution centers (RDCs). To supplement the previous qualitative assessment of the plan and to potentially justify continuing with its implementation, this paper aims to evaluate the prospective long-term performance of the planned RDCs within a hub-and-spoke (HS) network. The chosen methodology for this analysis is a hybrid of optimization and simulation, using an agent-based modeling and simulation platform that incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) element to provide a realistic geographical context. This constitutes a relatively novel innovation in logistics research. Experiments were developed to estimate the logistics performance of the hub-and-spoke network and planned RDCs, as well as to identify potential problems such as bottlenecks at the RDCs and the relative (in)efficiency of the selected multimodal transport. Transport costs, inventory costs, and the order backlog of RDCs are evaluated based on the average results from 100 replications. Outcomes from the model are validated against empirical data on Indonesia's logistics costs from the World Bank. Model results indicate that the hub-and-spoke network performs better than the point-to-point network when it comes to transportation costs. Since this is found to be the dominant element of total logistics costs, appropriate modal choice and route optimization are, therefore, critical to reducing logistics costs. The planned RDCs are found to have significant imbalance in their loadings, which is likely to produce bottlenecks. The paper concludes that a planned move to a hub-and spoke system is appropriate and that the planned investment in the RDCs is therefore justified. However, there is a need to streamline the predicted loadings at the RDCs to avoid bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the government should reopen the case and reevaluate the locations and coverage of each RDC. More generically, it is concluded that the application of hybrid optimization and simulation using agent-based modeling and simulation is feasible and the methodological approach adopted herein is generalizable to other archipelagic logistics systems.

AB  - Urban rail transit (URT) public-private partnership (PPP) projects are long-term, complex projects involving numerous stakeholders. Various unforeseeable events make the benefits of these projects uncertain, and disputes about the distribution and adjustment of benefits can seriously threaten project success. Therefore, there is a pressing need to effectively evaluate the project benefits available to various stakeholders and design a dynamic benefit-adjustment mechanism to ensure the successful completion of URT PPP projects. In full consideration of the complexities of projects of this nature and the adaptive behaviors of different stakeholders, a modeling framework was proposed to simulate the realization and dynamic adjustment of project benefits as a complex and comprehensive system defined by the microlevel dynamic behaviors of stakeholders and interactions among these behaviors through agent-based modeling (ABM). The framework was utilized to emulate a real-world URT PPP project for demonstration purposes. Next, two scenarios were simulated that considered the effects of the purchase behavior of the public and decisions concerning benefit adjustment on project benefits. The framework is a powerful decision support tool with regard to the benefits of URT PPP projects in that it can promote the maximization of overall benefits and the sustainability of URT projects.

AB  - Boarding is one of the major processes of airplane turnaround time, with a direct influence on the airline companies' costs. From a sustainable point of view, a faster completion of the boarding process has impact not only on the airline company's long-term performance, but also on customers' satisfaction and on the airport's possibility of offering more services without additional investments in new infrastructure. Considering the airplane boarding strategies literature, it can be observed that the latest papers are dealing with developing faster boarding strategies, most of them considering boarding using just one-door of the aircraft. Even though boarding on one-door might be feasible for the airports having the needed infrastructure and sufficient jet-bridges, the situation is different in European airports, as the use of apron buses is fairly common. Moreover, some of the airline companies have adapted their boarding pass in order to reflect which door one should board once they get down from the bus. While using these buses, the boarding strategies developed in the literature are hard to find their applicability. Thus, a new method for boarding on two-door airplanes when apron buses are used is proposed and tested against the actual boarding method. A model is created in NetLogo 6.0.4, taking advantages of the agent-based modeling and used for simulations. The results show a boarding time reduction of 8.91%.

AB  - Which policies can increase the resilience of the financial system to climate risks? Recent evidence on the significant impacts of climate change and natural disasters on firms, banks and other financial institutions call for a prompt policy response. In this paper, we employ a macro-financial agent-based model to study the interaction between climate change, credit and economic dynamics and test a mix of policy interven-tions. We first show that financial constraints exacerbate the impact of climate shocks on the economy while, at the same time, climate damages to firms make the banking sector more prone to crises. We find that credit provision can both increase firms' productivity and their financial fragility, with such a trade-off being exacerbated by the effects of climate change. We then test a set of "green" finance policies addressing these risks, while fostering climate change mitigation: i) green Basel-type capital requirements, ii) green public guarantees to credit, and iii) carbon-risk adjustment in credit ratings. All the policies reduce carbon emissions and the resulting climate impacts, though moderately. However, their effects on financial and real dynamics is not straightforwardly positive. Some combinations of policies fuel credit booms, exacerbating financial instability and increasing public debt. We show that the combination of the three policies leads to a virtuous cycle of (mild) emission reductions, stable financial sector and high economic growth. Additional tools would be needed to fully adapt to climate change. Hence, our results point to the need to complement financial policies cooling down climate-related risks with mitigation policies curbing emissions from real economic activities.

AB  - Distribution of goods affects city congestion and air pollution; it also increases costs and reduces quality of life. City logistics are aimed at reducing the negative effects of distribution while supporting city development. Over the past two decades, many city logistics initiatives have failed in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. As many actors and stakeholders are involved in the complex organizational process of city logistics, it is important to investigate and understand the causes of these failures. This is the purpose of this article, which considers Italian experiences of city logistics. Evaluation of city logistics initiatives is necessary to ensure success in future implementation, to achieve sustainable urban freight transport development. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been applied to evaluate different fields, such as supply chain, stock market, freight distribution, and traffic management. We conducted a review on city logistics projects in the main Italian cities with experience in these initiatives, in particular, in the case of failure. Our analysis considered the MAS, which utilizes multiple stakeholders' points of view with different effects to improve city logistics feasibility. The study considers Italian experiences in city logistics, but other countries may have different backgrounds and different situations. Therefore, predictions may be valid only for Italy and not in other contexts. Our perspective is quite original compared with the existing literature as it focuses on the failures of city logistics projects rather than best practices.

AB  - To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido-Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy.

AB  - Within environmental sociology there exists a debate between competing theories of societal development and its accompanying ecological repercussions and possible solutions. Environmental reform (ecological modernization) and unsustainable economic system (treadmill of production, ecological unequal exchange, and structural human ecology) theories propose two very different paths for the direction of society in addressing the multiple ecological crises of the 21(st) century. Both approaches provide theoretical and practical strides in addressing these questions within environmental sociology; however, both also fail to address important foci for the future. For us to continue to thrive as a species we must reconsider our relationship with nature and abandon our anthropocentric views of nature by taking a position that recognizes our role in a complex system. Ultimately, mechanisms for building resilience and adaptation and reducing vulnerability rely upon a paradigm shift, an understanding of "true" and "false" sustainability, and adaptation and resilience strategies that afford us an opportunity to recast social-ecological relationships towards "true" sustainability.

TI  - It's not the 'what', but the 'how': Exploring the role of debt in natural resource (un) sustainability
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - GROWTH
KW  - PROTOCOL
AB  - A debt-based economy cannot survive without economic growth. However, if private debt consistently grows faster than GDP, the consequences are financial crises and the current unprecedented level of global debt. This policy dilemma is aggravated by the lack of analyses factoring the impact of debt-growth cycles on the environment. What is really the relationship between debt and natural resource sustainability, and what is the role of debt in decoupling economic growth from natural resource availability? Here we present a conceptual Agent-Based Model (ABM) that integrates an environmental system into an ABM representation of Steve Keen's debt-based economic models. Our model explores the extent to which debt-driven processes, within debt-based economies, enhance the decoupling between economic growth and the availability of natural resources. Interestingly, environmental and economic collapse in our model are not caused by debt growth, or the debt-based nature of the economic system itself (i.e. the 'what'), but rather, these are due to the inappropriate use of debt by private actors (i.e. the 'how'). Firms inappropriately use bank credits for speculative goals-rather than production-oriented ones-and for exponentially increasing rates of technological development. This context creates temporal mismatches between natural resource growth and firms' resource extraction rates, as well as between economic growth and the capacity of the government to effectively implement natural resource conservation policies. This paper discusses the extent to which economic growth and the availability of natural resources can be re-coupled through a more sustainable use of debt, for instance by shifting mainstream banking forces to partially support environmental conservation as well as economic growth.

AB  - Early and deep electricity decarbonisation is critical to achieve the overall energy transition target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This paper extends an electricity agent based model to capture the inter-dependence of consistent governance with underpinning societal pressure and resultant investment strategies. Results show only with the strongest level of governance - reflected in the range of national/local policy mechanisms used, and their strength/timing when interim targets are met/missed - can near-zero electricity emissions be met well before 2050. Strong governance can also ensure a stable electricity system, with consistent policies mitigating the intensity of any investment cycles. Strong governance entails higher capital investments, but these can deliver lower electricity prices in the long-term. And strong governance means that a successful electricity decarbonisation does not need to be built solely on existing incumbents, but also via local cooperatives to aggregate household financing and demand side management. However, with inconsistent governance, a vicious cycle ensues with a weak rationale to enact ambitious policies at both the local and national levels, significant inertia in new electricity investments, and hence "failure" scenarios of decarbonisation. This challenges the prior findings of optimistic achievement of electricity decarbonisation scenarios by standard techno-economic optimisation models.

AB  - To meet the demands for resources, food and energy, especially in fast developing countries in the Global South, new infrastructure investments, technologies and supply chains are required. It is essential to manage a transition that minimises the impacts on global environmental degradation while benefits local socio-economic development. Food-bioenergy integration optimising natural capital resources and considering wider environmental and socio-economic sustainability offers a way forward. This study presents an integrative approach enabling whole systems modelling to address the interlinkage and interaction of resource-food-bioenergy systems and optimise supply chains considering poly-centric decision spaces. Life cycle sustainability assessment, optimisation, agent-based modelling and simulation were coupled to build an integrated systems modelling framework applicable to the resource-food-bioenergy nexus. The model building blocks are described before their applications in three case studies addressing agricultural residues and macro-fungi in the Philippines, sugar cane biorefineries in South Africa, and Nipa palm biofuel in Thailand. Our case studies revealed the great potential of untapped biomass including agricultural waste and non-food biomass grown on marginal lands. Two value chain integration case studies - i.e. straw-fungi-energy in Philippines and sugar-energy in Africa - have been suggested as sustainable solutions to recover waste as value-added products to meet food and energy security. Case studies highlight how an integrative modelling framework can be applied to address multilevel questions, taking into account decision-making at different levels, which contribute to an overall sustainability goal.

AB  - Across the world, cities are spending billions of dollars to manage urban runoff through decentralized green infrastructure (GI). This research uses an agent-based model to explore some of the physical, social, and economic consequences of one such urban GI programs. Using the Bronx, NY, as a case study, two alternative approaches to GI application are compared. The first (Model 1) mimics NYC's current GI program by opportunistically selecting sites for GI within the city's priority combined sewer watersheds; the second (Model 2) features a more spatially flexible approach to GI siting, in which the city attempts to maximize opportunities for co-benefits within the geographic areas considered in Model 1. The effects of both approaches, measured in terms of stormwater captured and co-benefits (e.g., carbon sequestered) provided, are tracked over 20-year simulations. While both models suggest it will be difficult to meet the citywide stormwater capture goals (managing the first 2.5 cm of rainfall from 10% of impervious surfaces) in the Bronx solely through public investment in GI, Model 2 shows that by integrating GI with other city initiatives (e.g., sustainability goals and resilience planning), synergistic outcomes are possible. Specifically, Model 2 produces stormwater capture rates comparable to those obtained under Model 1, but these rates are accompanied by elevated co-benefits for Bronx communities. The results are discussed in the context of future GI policy development in NYC.

AB  - Assessing the performance of an economy in times of crisis is a difficult task. This study presents an agent-based model capturing the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions due to natural disasters, and shows possible paths to reinforce infrastructure and supply chain resilience.
   Building resilience against shocks has become a pillar of sustainability. By understanding how the different components of an economy interact in times of crisis, we can design resilience strategies that go beyond building walls or dams. We formulate an original agent-based model to explore a crucial pathway through which a disaster affects the economy: the transport-supply chain nexus. The model simulates the behaviour of firms facing transport and supply disruptions and estimates the resulting indirect losses. As an illustration, the model is used to assess the criticality of Tanzanian roads, which are vulnerable to floods. We report three main results. First, the model generates maps that identify the transport infrastructure assets that are most critical for specific supply chains: roads that are most important for food security are different from those supporting international trade, for instance. Second, economic losses from transport disruptions increase non-linearly with the duration of disruptions, highlighting the benefit from fast repairs. Third, by combining economic and transport modelling, we can consider a broader spectrum of interventions. Beyond strengthening the transport system, it is also possible to make supply chains more resilient to disruption with, for instance, sourcing decisions or inventory management.

AB  - Intelligent agriculture has the potential of increasing sustainability and productivity in the field of agriculture and livestock, through efficient and precise use of resources. Thus, this technology gives the possibility of promoting growth in developing countries through automation and control of repetitive farming activities, such as monitoring the level of water and feed in the feeders, which allows farmers to save time. However, the implementation of an automatic feed and water level control system in a livestock enclosure requires a large investment in silo scales, which may be too expensive for an SME. Thanks to the evolution of IoT devices, it is possible to reduce the cost of this implementation while integrating new functionalities and interactions through the interconnection of devices with cloud solutions. This work presents a new system that allows to monitor the quantity and quality of food and water in a silo by estimating volume in real time. Moreover, it has an additional functionality; temperature and humidity estimation in a livestock enclosure. The hardware system will be managed by a multi-agent system in charge of the processes of managing the data, managing the quantity of food and water supplied to each feeder. The use of a multi-agent architecture allows for the development of a distributed solution that provides great possibilities for future analysis, for example through a massive data analysis. The case study results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, it has provided the ideal amount of feed and water to the animals, controlling the quality of grain and water, reducing the number of colics caused by overfeeding. In addition, the time the farmer must spend on the farm reduces considerably.

AB  - Many complex social questions are difficult to address adequately with conventional methods and techniques, due to the complicated dynamics, and hard to quantify social processes. Despite these difficulties researchers and practitioners have attempted to use conventional methods not only in evaluative modes but also in predictive modes to inform decision making. The effectiveness of SIAs would be increased if they were used to support the project design processes. This requires deliberate use of lessons from retrospective assessments to inform predictive assessments. Social simulations may be a useful tool for developing a predictive SIA method. There have been limited attempts to develop computer simulations that allow social impacts to be explored and understood before implementing development projects. In light of this argument, this paper aims to introduce system dynamic (SD) simulation as a new predictive SIA method in large development projects. We propose the potential value of the SD approach to simulate social impacts of development projects. We use data from the SIA of Gareh-Bygone floodwater spreading project to illustrate the potential of SD simulation in SIA. It was concluded that in comparison to traditional SIA methods SD simulation can integrate quantitative and qualitative inputs from different sources and methods and provides a more effective and dynamic assessment of social impacts for development projects. We recommend future research to investigate the full potential of SD in SIA in comparing different situations and scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The construction industry has been slow to adopt technologies like design automation and robotic fabrication due to high initial costs and long project cycles. However, demand for efficiency, sustainability and safety has spurred technological transformation. This study explores how technology spreads in construction by examining mimetic behaviour among enterprises of varying income levels using an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach. The model uses empirical data from literature to simulate interactions and economic impacts on adoption across high-, medium- and low-income enterprises. Findings show that high-income firms adopt technologies during economic growth to strengthen market position, while low-income firms invest during downturns to cut costs and enhance competitiveness. Medium-income firms adopt cautiously but steadily in stable growth scenarios. These results highlight economic conditions and income differences in shaping adoption strategies, offering insights for policymakers promoting technology diffusion in construction. As a premise work to explore quantifiable economic impact of technology adoption, this study has reviewed key economic drivers and barriers that may influence technology diffusion across different enterprise categories. Coupled this with the ABM findings, this study offers construction managers practical insights to align technology investments with economic trends, enabling them to reduce risks and enhance competitiveness under varying market conditions.

AB  - A sustainable development (SD) concept formulated 30 years ago has been, and will be, one of the most topical issues in the development of mankind. The fundamental question of this phenomenon is the quantification of the condition. There is no unified approach yet, despite numerous studies of all kinds. All proposed methods assess not sustainable development but rather the development of its individual components (economic, social, environmental) or socioeconomic systems (SES). In order to achieve an adequate quantification of SES SD, two aspects of this process should be distinguished: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative side is the order (dynamics) of the development of the socioeconomic system, which can be expressed in the degree and intensity of development. The qualitative side is the coherence of the development of SES as a complex system. Socioeconomic systems belong to large, complex systems with the structure as an essential characteristic, which is the basis for their stability. It is the harmony of development that reflects the coherence between structural changes in development and internal development processes. The complex quantification of SES in sustainable development integrates both sides of this process - quantitative and qualitative, i.e. sustainability and harmony.

AB  - Investment in sustainability strategies and technologies holds promise for significant cost savings over the operational phase of a facility's life cycle, while more effectively meeting stakeholder needs. However, accurately estimating the first costs of a green project during the early concept development stages is challenging, and effective ways to comprehensively predict potential lifecycle cost impacts of sustainability strategies do not exist. This paper describes a agent-based model (ABM) of the Total Cost of Ownership of green facilities applicable at the earliest stages of concept development. An ABM approach captures the social, environmental, and engineering systems that characterize a facility's life cycle cost. It permits evaluating the impact of the institutional and industry environment on facility life cycle performance, and also captures the cost impacts of tightly coupled facility systems that characterize green design.

AB  - Cooperative behaviour is a fundamental strategy for survival; it positively affects economies, social relationships, and makes larger societal structures possible. People vary, however, in their willingness to engage in cooperative behaviour in a particular context. Here we examine whether AI can be effectively used to to alter individuals' implicit understanding of cooperative dynamics, and hence increase cooperation and participation in public goods projects. We developed an intervention-the Sustainability Game (SG)-to allow players to experience the consequences of individual investment strategies on a sustainable society. Results show that the intervention significantly increases individuals' cooperative behaviour in partially anonymised public goods contexts, but enhances competition one-on-one. This indicates our intervention does improve transparency of the systemic consequences of individual cooperative behaviour.

AB  - Renewable energy investments require a substantial amount of capital to provide affordable and accessible energy for everyone in the world, and finding the required capital is one of the greatest challenges faced by governments and private entities. In a macroeconomic perspective, national budget deficits and inadequate policy designs hinder public and private investments in renewable projects. These problems lead governments to borrow a considerable amount of money for sustainable development, although such excessive debt-based financing pushes them to unsustainable economic development. This substantial amount of borrowing makes a negative contribution to the high global debt concentration, putting countries' economic and social development at risk. In line with this, excessive debt-based financing causes an increase in wealth inequality, and when wealth inequality reaches a dramatic level, wars and many other social problems are triggered to correct the course of wealth inequality. In this regard, the motivation behind the study is to develop a set of policy guidelines for sustainable financing models as a solution for these intertwined problems, which are: (1) a financial gap in energy investments; (2) an excessive global debt concentration; and (3) a dramatic increase in wealth inequality. To this end, this study presents a quantitative and comparative proof of concept analysis of alternative financing models in a solar farm investment simulation to investigate the change in wealth inequality and social welfare by reducing debt-based financing and increasing public participation. There are many studies in the literature investigating the evolution of wealth inequality throughout history. However, there is a gap in the literature, and investigating the effects of various policy rules on the evolution of wealth inequality in a future time frame needs to be explored in order to discuss possible policy implications beforehand. In this respect, this paper contributes to the literature by developing simulation models for conventional and alternative financing systems. This enables investigating the changes in wealth inequality and social welfare as a result of various policy implications throughout the simulation time.

AB  - Bees and beekeeping are increasingly recognised as important contributors to sustainable development. Beekeeping is a landscape-scale process that involves complex interconnectivities between beekeepers, beehives and bee forage. Yet, accounting for these interactions within beekeeping system models is challenging as in-teractions are dynamic and often influenced by human behaviour and decision making. To this end, this research describes a spatially explicit modelling approach B-Agent, which draws upon multiple stakeholder engagement, a machine-learning algorithm and an agent-based model to simulate beehive migration processes. The Western Australian beekeeping sector provides a case study for model development and testing, to examine changes in (i) distances travelled by beekeepers, (ii) the frequency of beehive migration, and (iii) the spatial distribution of harvest locations resulting from climate related impacts on forage availability. The results indicate an increase in travel distance and frequency of hive migrations for commercial beekeepers under a moderate emissions climate scenario and indicated an eastward shift in the spatial distribution of harvest locations. The approach provides an evidence-base for better-informed management decisions in order to improve the long-term sustainability of beekeeping systems in Western Australia and beyond.

AB  - Over time, design instructors have become more encouraged to accommodate the play metaphor in their courses, for its rich technical and psychological assets. While there are issues regarding the interactive narrative structure of the game, embodied Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) have been introduced to address these issues and handle complicated game objectives. With the ever-growing complexity of design concepts and the mounting demand to design for sustainability, more variables and intricacies are introduced to the design and decision making process. This paper presents a proposed method that utilizes MAS in game engines to resolve the environment design complexity for design students and untrained professionals. This method offers better comprehension of the implication of data generated from building analysis tools, and presents guidelines to develop the proposed design accordingly.

AB  - Agriculture is a complex system in which the economic principles of production are directly intertwined with its biological and ecological characteristics. The paper investigates synergetic potentials of multiple:criteria and multiple-perspective evaluation of agricultural activity through a study of the dairy sector in Slovenia. Socioeconomic and emergy evaluation was performed on nine farm types, formulated to represent the diversity of the country's dairy sector. The results indicate larger discrepancies in the performance of the farm types when defined by socio-economic or emergy based indicators. Standard socio-economic evaluation favours larger conventional systems that are cost efficient and financially independent. Emergy analysis however, favours less productive organic farms, which show greater ability to exploit free local resources and produce less stress on the local environment. Socio-economic and emergy indicators show that small conventional farm types are the poorest performers overall. Analysis of emergy flows reveals for all farm types a high dependency on the wider socio-economic system, suggesting that within the current economic system agriculture itself has little ability to affect its sustainability. The paper suggests a complementarity in the evaluation approaches. Their joint application can improve the quality of the decision-making process in various stages of planning in agriculture and land use. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agrifood chains are complex systems; they encompass biological, economic, social, health and political variables at different scales (e.g., on-farm, local, regional, national and global). Consequently, what enables a food system to achieve 'sustainability' is also complex. This is particularly the case in small-scale societies in developing nations which are socially constituted. In this paper we posit that ahabitus of informalityunderpins food systems' sustainability in these societies. We argue that conventional applications of approaches like the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) and Circles of Sustainability (CoS) frameworks fail to assist understanding of sustainability in informal socio-economic systems because they either place too much emphasis on economic growth (TBL) or underplay the strength of socio-cultural obligations and responsibilities (CoS). This is seen in international aid programs that encourage economic growth in the agrifood sector, which is challenging for villages in such societies. We review data from two Pacific Island countries-Tonga and Solomon Islands-to demonstrate the need for a more holistic way to think about sustainability in informal agrifood systems in small-scale developing nations. We demonstrate the value of employing a Hybrid Value Chain Framework for collecting information necessary to understanding how sustainability is constituted in the food systems of small-scale societies.

AB  - Recent literatures about complex systems indicate that the economy self-organizes under control mechanisms. By applying the theory of control mechanism to capitalism, this paper analyzes why the ongoing world financial crisis is a credit crisis and the epistemological root of credit crisisinformation asymmetry. Furthermore, this paper argues that neo-liberalism economic system and the defective credit management system, which lead to the deficient government supervision and consistent lack of effective government supervision, caused the world financial crisis. This paper also argues that rescue measures taken by many countries cannot resolve the financial crisis fundamentally. Some measures are proposed at the end of this paper to strengthen the negative feedbacks, aiming at defusing or avoiding crises fundamentally. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this article, the goal is to offer a new research agenda for evolutionary macroeconomics. The article commences with a broad review of the main ideas in the history of thought concerning the determinants of economic growth and an introduction to the evolutionary perspective. This followed by a selective review of recent evolutionary approaches to macroeconomics. These approaches are found to be somewhat disconnected. It is argued that the 'micro-meso-macro' approach to economic evolution is capable of resolving this problem by offering an analytical framework in which macroeconomics can be built upon 'meso-foundations', not micro-foundations, as asserted in the mainstream. It is also stressed that the economic system and its components are complex adaptive systems and that this complexity must not be assumed away through the imposition of simplistic assumptions made for analytical convenience. It is explained that complex economic systems are, at base, energetic in character but differ from biological complex systems in the way that they collect, store and apply knowledge. It is argued that a focus upon stocks and flows of energy and knowledge in complex economic systems can yield an appropriate analytical framework for macroeconomics. It is explained how such a framework can be connected with key insights of both Schumpeter and Keynes that have been eliminated in modern macroeconomics. A macroeconomic framework that cannot be operationalized empirically is of limited usefulness so, in the last part of the article, an appropriate methodology for evolutionary macroeconomics is discussed.

AB  - Nowadays, organizations are required to be part of a global collaborative world. Sometimes this is the only way they can access new and wider markets, reaching new opportunities, skills and sharing assets, e.g. tools, lessons learnt. However, due to the different sources of enterprise models and semantics, organizations are experiencing difficulties in exchanging information electronically and seamlessly. To solve this issue, most of them try to attain interoperability by establishing peer-to-peer mapping morphisms with different business partners, or in optimized networks use neutral data standards to regulate communications. Moreover, more and more enterprise systems are dynamic, looking forward to meet further requirements, causing new interoperability problems and efficiency reduction. This paper proposes a multi-agent framework to monitor existing enterprise system networks, being capable of detecting morphism changes. An example from systems engineering is presented, where network harmonization breakings are timely detected, and possible solutions are suggested to regain the interoperable status, thus enhancing robustness for reaching sustainability of business networks.

AB  - Intelligent products are an undeniable asset for efficient product lifecycle management (PLM), providing ways to capture events related to physical objects at various locations and times. Today and more than ever before, PLM tools and systems must be built upon standards for enhancing interoperability among all product stakeholders and developing tools independent of specific vendors, applications, and operating systems. Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve "information sustainability" in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle. Our proposals are implemented and assessed based on two distinct platforms defined in the healthcare and home automation sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Water supply and demand management (WSDM) is essential for developing sustainable cities and societies. WSDM is only effective when tackled from the perspective of a holistic system understanding that considers social, environmental, hydrological, and economic (SEHEc) sub-systems. System dynamics modeling (SDM) is recommended by water resource researchers as it models the biophysical and socio-economic systems simultaneously. This study presents a comprehensive literature review of SDM applications in sustainable WSDM. The reviewed articles were methodologically analyzed considering SEHEc sub-systems and the type of modeling approach used. This study revealed that problem conceptualization using the causal loop diagram (CLD) was performed in only 58% of the studies. Moreover, 70% of the reviewed articles used the stock flow diagram (SFD) to perform a quantitative system analysis. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement plays a significant role in understanding the core issues and divergent views and needs of users, but it was incorporated by only 36% of the studies. Although climate change significantly affects water management strategies, only 51% of the reviewed articles considered it. Although the scenario analysis is supported by simulation models, they further require the optimization models to yield optimal key parameter values. One noticeable finding is that only 12% of the articles used quantitative models to complement SDM for the decision-making process. The models included agent-based modeling (ABM), Bayesian networking (BN), analytical hierarchy approach (AHP), and simulation optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO). The solution approaches included the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The key findings for the sustainable development of water resources included the per capita water reduction, water conservation through public awareness campaigns, the use of treated wastewater, the adoption of efficient irrigation practices including drip irrigation, the cultivation of low-water-consuming crops in water-stressed regions, and regulations to control the overexploitation of groundwater. In conclusion, it is established that SDM is an effective tool for devising strategies that enable sustainable water supply and demand management.

AB  - This article proposes a fundamental methodological shift in the modelling of policy interventions for sustainability transitions in order to account for complexity (e.g. self-reinforcing mechanisms, such as technology lock-ins, arising from multi-agent interactions) and agent heterogeneity (e.g. differences in consumer and investment behaviour arising from income stratification). We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative, optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual influences among agents (multi-agent interactions) and capture related self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low carbon policies, (3) interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and (4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology is subsequently discussed by reference to four specific applications relating to each of the above areas: the diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. In conclusion, the article calls for a fundamental methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with that of the climatic system, fora combined and realistic understanding of the impact of sustainability policies.

AB  - Dynamic models have long been a common tool to support management of ecological and economic systems and played a prominent role in the early days of resilience research. Model applications have largely focused on policy assessment, the development of optimal management strategies, or analysis of system stability. However, modeling can serve many other purposes such as understanding system responses that emerge from complex interactions of system components, supporting participatory processes, and analyzing consequences of human behavioral complexity. The diversity of purposes, types, and applications of models offers great potential for social-ecological systems (SESs) research, but has created much confusion because modeling approaches originate from different disciplines, are based on different assumptions, focus on different levels of analysis, and use different analytical methods. This diversity makes it difficult to identify which approach is most suitable for addressing a specific question. Here, our aims are: (1) to introduce the most common types of dynamic models used in SESs research and related fields, and (2) to align these models with SESs research aims to support the selection and communication of the most suitable approach for a given study. To this end, we organize modeling approaches into a reference scheme called "modelling for social-ecological systems research" (ModSES) along two dimensions: the degree of realism and the degree of knowledge integration. These two dimensions capture key challenges of SESs research related to the need to account for context dependence and the intertwined nature of SESs as systems of humans embedded in nature across multiple scales, as well as to acknowledge different problem framings, understandings, interests, and values. We highlight the need to be aware of the potentials, limitations, and conceptual backgrounds underlying the different approaches. Critical engagement with modeling for different aims of SESs research can contribute to developing integrative understanding and action toward enhanced resilience and sustainability.

AB  - The sustainability of social development can be signified by the level of coordinated development of regional education-economy-human capital complex system (REEHCCS). However, the existing studies on the coordinated development of systems fail to consider the influence of human capital on specific systems, or identify the root causes of the complex state of the coordinated development. To solve the problem, this paper explores the modeling and simulation for the coordinated development of REEHCCS. Specifically, the REEHCCS structure was modeled, and reasonable evaluation indices were selected for coordination. Then, an REEHCCS coordination model was constructed, and the classification principles were detailed for the coordinated development of complex systems. On this basis, education and human capital were introduced to the dynamic Haavelmo model to identify the state and analyze the evolution of the REEHCCS. Finally, the proposed model was proved effective through simulation and case analysis. This study explores the complex interactions between regional education, economy, and human capital, and assesses their coordinated development through the construction of a coordination model and simulation experiments. The research findings indicate that the constructed model can effectively identify and analyze the coordinated development state and evolution trends of the regional education-economy-human capital system.

AB  - We present novel insights about effective energy policies using an agent-based model. The model describes relevant feedback mechanisms between technological evolution, the interbank market and the electricity sector. Analysis with it shows that energy policies affect interbank connectivity and hence the likelihood of cascades of bank failures. This effect has not been studied before in the literature. In particular, we find that investments in renewable energy reduce interbank connectivity, increasing the probability of bank failures, while raising taxes on energy has an opposite effect. Increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity production initially increases the price of electricity, and thus improves profits and the ability to re-pay debts of incumbent power plants. However, when the share of renewable energy increases too quickly, financial stability may be at stake as the burden of financing investments in renewable energy offsets the improved profitability of existing power stations. All in all, this study provides a unique and novel perspective on the relationship between renewable energy investments and financial stability.

AB  - This paper reviews definitions and uses of the Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework and argues that it is a relevant too] for structuring communication between scientists and end-users of environmental information. while it is inappropriate as an analytical tool. An apparently deterministic 'causal' description of environmental issues inevitably downplays the uncertainty and multiple dimensions of causality inherent in complex environmental and socio-economic systems. Consequently, the paper complements and reframes 'DPSIR' using a complex system methodology based on the distinction between four 'spheres' of sustainability (environmental, economic, social and political) and the analysis of their functioning and relationships. The pair-wise interface aspects are characterised through investigation of the 'demands' and 'supply' of each sphere relative to the others.
   Within the resulting conceptual framework, each of the five D, P, S. I and R concepts are specified, for application in integrative analysis of relationships between policy, society, economy and biodiversity in one of the world's largest European integrated research projects on biodiversity (ALARM).

AB  - We investigate the possibility that capitalist economies - those that industrialized first and the whole OECD group - may be reaching the growth plateau naturally, in a similar way to other complex systems in nature. In the system model of autocatalytic growth we introduce endogenous and exogenous variables that provide negative feedbacks to material growth and push the economic system into the mature stage of development. Based on general developmental stages for dissipative systems, we identify variables that would uniquely mark the transition to maturity: p.c. energy consumption, GDP and energy consumption distribution, and sector composition of labor and GDP. Empirical findings suggest that the observed groups of economies may have terminated their historic phase of intensive economic growth and are entering the mature stage. This provides a tentative explanation of the observed slow-down of long-run rates of GDP growth in the G7 economies and in Western Europe. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digitalisation is likely to change established economic development processes. This raises questions about the distribution of the potential welfare gains from industrialisation highlighted by, among others, the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 'sustainable industrialisation'. In parallel, industrialisation and digitalisation must be made environmentally sustainable if other pressing sustainability goals, such as climate change mitigation (SDG 13), are to be met. Yet, under the current political and economic system, efficiency gains in material resources and energy associated with digitalisation are prone to aggregate to macro-level growth ('digital rebound') that may exacerbate the ecological harm of industrialisation, rather than alleviating it. In this article, applying the CPERI/CSPK approach (Cultural Political Economy of Research and Innovation/Complex Systems of Power-Knowledge approach), we argue that digital rebound should be a central research parameter in research on digitalisation and sustainability. Thinking strategically about different models of digitalization, which we call the 'human-machine associational model' and the 'machinic micro-efficiency model', may enable not only change in the trajectory of digitalisation itself. It could also indirectly address the dominant regime of political economy at the system-level, which will either propel or contain digital rebound. We conclude the article by opening up lines of enquiry, for both research and practice to approach a 'system-questioning' model of digitalisation.

KW  - economic impact evaluation
AB  - The EU Directive 2000/60/EC, also known as the "Framework directive in the field of water policy", stresses the importance of water in human development processes and states that EU members should coordinate water policies towards a sustainable use of this resource; hence, water has a strategic role both for present and future generations and should be managed using a systemic approach.
   Sustainable policies for the management of water resources must also foresee the setting up of complex systems for analysis and evaluation which must be able to control and govern the entire water system, taking into account both sustainability and the economic impacts of the policies adopted.
   In our paper, we propose a model which, on one hand, describes the physical relationships among different economic activities and the natural water cycle, while allowing us, on the other hand, to evaluate the economic impact of water policy sustainability. For doing this, we integrate a material flow account approach with a national accounting scheme (NAMEA). This new framework allows the analyst to consider both the effect of given policies on the water cycle and the constraint produced by the sustainability problem on the economic system.

AB  - From a public finance point of view, achieving sustainable development hinges on two critical factors: the subnational implementation of public policies and the efficient allocation of resources across regions through vertical intergovernmental transfers. We introduce a framework that links these two mechanisms for analyzing the impact of reallocating federal transfers in the presence of regional heterogeneity from development indicators, budget sizes, expenditure returns, and long-term structural factors. Our study focuses on the case of Mexico and its 32 states. Using an agent-based computational model, we estimate the development gaps that will remain by the year 2030, and characterize their sensitivity to changes in the states' budget sizes. Then, we estimate the optimal distribution of federal transfers to minimize these gaps. Crucially, these distributions depend on the specific development objectives set by the national government, and by various interdependencies between the heterogeneous qualities of the states. This work sheds new light on the complex problem of budgeting for the Sustainable Development Goals at the subnational level, and it is especially relevant for the study of fiscal decentralization from the expenditure point of view.

AB  - Clean production is a new and creative paradigm that employs the environmental strategy of continuous overall prevention on the production process, products, and services. On the background of sustainable development, there is an urgent need for a method to quantitatively analyze the sustainability of a corporation's clean production. Emergy analysis theory explores a new perspective in the complex system of nature, the economy and society from all dimensions and develops a new method for quantitatively studying ecological systems, ecological economic systems and human activities. This method also provides a valid criterion for appraising sustainable development. In this paper, a longitudinal comparative study on the sustainability of the clean production of enterprise was conducted based on the emergy theory, using the example of Xinjiang Tianye Industrial Park, with the aim of identifying the development direction of the chloro-alkali industrial system from a sustainable perspective, and providing a scientific basis for stipulating appropriate management and control measures and development strategies. The results show that the clean production is the effective way of sustainable development of enterprise.

AB  - Today's economic systems are, on the one hand, exposed to various risks and uncertainties with their trends changing almost daily, while on the other hand, they represent an extremely complex system with a large number of sustainable influential parameters. The challenge is to model macroeconomic parameters and achieve sustainability, yet also satisfy conflict situations with an increased level of uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to create an appropriate functional model by examining the mutual influence of various macroeconomic factors. It assesses a total of four scenarios considering mutual influences of: FDI (foreign direct investments), GDP (gross domestic product), imports, exports, inflation rate, RER (real exchange rate) and employment rate as defined parameters. First, the DEA (Data envelopment analysis) model was applied to determine the initial efficiency of two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) and Serbia, for the period 2005-2020. Then, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied in combination with DEA to obtain more precise values. In addition, IMF SWARA (Improved Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) was applied to define weight coefficients of macro-economic parameters. Finally, the CRADIS (compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution) model was applied for the final ranking of part of decision-making units. This developed, integrated model can be classified as a mathematical method for economic analysis and gives extended opportunities for solving different problems. The results show that 2009, 2013 and 2016 were the most favorable years in terms of the conditions set when it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 2012, 2014 and 2016 when it comes to Serbia. These years have been singled out and can be a benchmark for further handling and modeling of macroeconomic elements. In addition, correlation was tested using statistical coefficients.

AB  - The Crop-Hydrological-Agent Modeling Platform (PyCHAMP) is a Python-based open-source package designed for modeling agro-hydrological systems. The modular design, incorporating aquifer, crop field, groundwater well, finance, and behavior components, enables users to simulate and analyze the interactions between human and natural systems, considering both environmental and socio-economic factors. This study demonstrates PyCHAMP's capabilities by simulating the dynamics in the Sheridan 6 Local Enhanced Management Area, a groundwater conservation program in the High Plains Aquifer in Kansas. We highlight how a model, empowered by PyCHAMP, accurately captures human-water dynamics, including groundwater level, water withdrawal, and the fraction of cropland dedicated to each crop. We also show how farmer behavior, and its representation, drives system outcomes more strongly than environmental conditions. The results indicate PyCHAMP's potential as a useful tool for human-water research and sustainable groundwater management, offering prospects for future integration with detailed sub-models and systematic evaluation of model structural uncertainty.

AB  - The formation of an effective economic system on an innovative basis is one of the most important tasks of the current stage of socio-economic development, since the systemic interaction of all elements of the economic system, forming a single economic space, allows for the most effective realisation of the benefits of the division of labour and specialisation in innovative forms. At the same time, the ability of production and economic entities to maintain the ability to expand the reproduction of innovations (while maintaining the scale and pace of innovation reproduction) in the event of disturbing internal and external actions - innovation sustainability - is becoming increasingly important. This is particularly important in the formation of integrated associations and integral economic complexes as sustainable systems to increase the dynamics and balance of the proportions of the innovation reproduction process. In the context of continuity and heterogeneity of innovations, it is extremely important to consider their innovation sustainability from the perspective of a systemic approach to the management of an economic system. Purpose of the article. The scope of research on strategic management of regional development is quite wide, but given the current economic situation, the consequences of the pandemic and martial law, this issue needs even more attention, as most regions of Ukraine are unstable and economically unprofitable, so it is necessary to consider special levers and directions that will help strategically effective management of regional enterprises and ensure their economic security. Methodology. The methodological basis of the article is a set of methods and principles of scientific knowledge, general and special methods and techniques used in the study. The theoretical basis of the study is the scientific work of domestic and foreign scientists on sustainable development, economic security and innovation. The information base is based on official statistics, reports and accounting information of enterprises, resources and publications of the Internet, and the results of the author's own research. Practical implications. The results obtained and the recommendations developed form the basis for improving the strategic management of the sustainable development of regional enterprises while ensuring their economic security. Value/originality. A mechanism of strategic management of sustainable development of regional enterprises was created using a system -synergistic approach, which includes a system of resources, methods and tools for influencing innovation processes and is based on the principles of self -organisation of complex systems in the process of their adaptation to changes in an unstable environment and ensuring economic security, which will allow to coordinate the goals and directions of management of investment, operational and financial activities of regional enterprises to ensure their sustainable development.

AB  - The recent history of the European Union (EU) suggests the importance of studying the conditions under which two or more countries can benefit from becoming part of a union. Of course, this depends both on the economic characteristics of the involved countries and on the scope of the union, i.e., the level of integration of markets, regulations, and institutional bodies. This study tackles the topic from the angle of agent-based computational economics, by designing an open-economy model, inspired from the EU, where countries can be part of a trade and monetary union. We find that, for similar countries, it is always beneficial to be a member of a union, although a lack of mobility frictions can cause a divergence between the two countries, weakening the overall union performance. Even if countries have different productivity, the performance of the union is in general better than the performance of the isolated countries. The exception is when productivity gap and labor mobility are both high. In this case, a strong migration within the union can create economic distortions, exacerbating the gap between the member states. Stronger fiscal integration helps reducing inequality between countries, increasing the sustainability of the monetary union. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Farm production often involves family-owned agribusinesses where decisions are made by households or individuals, not corporate managers. As these decisions have important economic, environmental, and social implications, decision-making processes must be understood to foster sustainable agricultural production. Decision experiments, involving lotteries, targeting farmers in the Argentine Pampas were used to estimate prospect theory (PT) parameters. Results suggest that decisions under risk are better represented by prospect theory than by expected utility (EU) theory: Decision makers treat gains and losses differently and use subjective probabilities of outcomes; they are quite loss averse and are more likely to overweigh probabilities of infrequent events, such as large droughts or floods. Statistical testing revealed heterogeneity in the risk tied to land tenure (land owners vs. renters) and agribusiness roles (farmers vs. technical advisors). Perceptions of risk, probability, and outcomes played a large role in the sustainability of production. Due to a strong desire to avoid losses, decision makers have a greater short term focus: Immediate economic outcomes are more salient, and environmental and social investments are framed as costs rather than long-term gains. This research can help design policies, programs, and tools that assist agribusinesses in managing better contradictions across the triple bottom line to ensure greater sustainability.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effects on the economy of a feed-in tariff policy mechanism aimed to foster investments in renewable energy production capacity. To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path.

AB  - The water-energy-food-climate nexus has risen rapidly in global water governance over the past decade. This article examines the role of global financial networks in articulating the nexus and in connecting it to sustainability programs. It provides new insights into critical engagements with the nexus that, to date, have focused predominantly on water security and governance. The article examines how global financial networks conceptualized and concretized the nexus towards two ends: First, the nexus was used to effect the transition from state-oriented development models to financialized approaches of water development and sustainability. Here, the nexus was formulated in critique of, and as a solution to, the previously dominant approach to water development: integrated water resources management (IWRM). Second, the nexus was deployed to connect water, energy, food, and climate to the global economy in terms of complex systems. The identification of risks to the resilience of environmental and economic systems provided a new form of integration across the supply chains affected by the governance and security of water, energy, food, and climate. In both cases, the nexus mobilizes technologies of global finance, such as credit-risk ratings, to construct and defend new strategies for governing water security and to enable sub-sovereign actors, such as municipalities, to be incorporated into the global economy. The paper concludes that alignments of the nexus with sustainability programs, and the Sustainable Development Goals, must be reconsidered in view of the constraints posed by financial orientations towards the risks and resilience of economic and environmental systems.

AB  - This study presents an ecological accounting for the Chinese society using improved extended exergy accounting method. Based on the input-output table of China, we capture the economic linkages of societal labor and capital fluxes, and improve the equivalent exergy metrics of labor and capital to be consistent with the Chinese situation. Material and externalities-equivalent exergy structures are examined by the quantitative estimation and indi-cator assessment. Results show that the total resource consumption of the Chinese society amounted to 151.6 EJ in 2012, while the total equivalent exergetic values of labor, capital and environmental remediation cost were estimated at 67.0 EJ, 69.1 EJ and 411.5 EJ, respectively. The national total capital and labor input was close to its resource consumption, but only equal to one third of the environmental remediation cost, highlighting the contribution of ecosystem products and services. An overall system diagram covering major extended-exergy inflows and outflows within the society was designed to display the complex metabolism process and network relationship of resource use, economic production and environmental externalities in an integrative way. Exergy and extended exergy analyses of the Chinese society for a benchmark year contributes to understanding the operation of a socio-economic system from a biophysical perspective and establishing effective regulatory strategies of production and consumption activities to accelerate a shift towards sustainability.

AB  - Ecological economics is a field of enquiry that has had, with a few exceptions, an almost entirely terrestrial focus. Given the fundamental ecological and economic importance of oceanic and coastal ecosystems, and the accelerating deterioration of these ecosystems, we argue that there is an urgent case to redress this imbalance. In so doing, the scope of ecological economics will be extended and compelling insights developed and applied to better understand and govern marine systems. Although we acknowledge that there is no unequivocal or unitary view of what might constitute an ecological economics of the oceans and coasts, we assert that it should consist of at least 'four cornerstones': (1) sustainability as the normative goal; (2) an approach that sees the socio-economic system as a sub-system of the global ecological system; (3) a complex systems approach; and (4) transdisciplinarity and methodological pluralism. Using these four cornerstones, we identify a future research agenda for an ecological economics of the oceans and coasts. Specifically, we conclude that ecological economists must work with other disciplines, especially those involved in marine policy and practice, to move from a 'frontier economics' (which has dominated marine management) to entrench an 'ecological economics' of the oceans and coasts as the dominant paradigm.

AB  - Every day more evidence surfaces about the dire state of the environment. More and more, sustainable development is fundamentally about meeting human needs while restoring balance to the global ecosystem that is failing, Greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets and other new environmental performance targets are rapidly being adopted across the globe to try to shore up this degradation.
   We are finally entering the era of broad scale environmental accountability. Achieving sustainability performance targets across complex and integrated social, ecological, and economic systems requires new ways of engineering the way we interact with the environment. In turn, ecologically engineering the built environment requires new quantitative performance approaches to planning. It requires understanding and analyzing the complex systematic relationships between the built and natural environment and capitalizing on the efficiencies that can be found through integrated design.
   The sustainability movement is currently focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the threats to sustainability run much deeper than that. Climate change is driving changes to nearly all ecosystem services upon which we rely. Reducing carbon emissions has taken a front seat in sustainability programming, but typically through a some what focused lens of energy and transportation systems.
   This paper will discuss an approach to sustainability that is more holistic and ecosystem based. One that optimizes the ecological opportunities of a site and technology to make the built environment more sustainably integrated with the natural environment at the site, region, and global scale.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis is a promising business model that pushes companies to move from linear production to a circular path. However, this transformation is complex because it requires companies to rethink and redesign their supply chains by considering the involvement of new stakeholders, the introduction of waste and their impact on product development, economic investments, and technological resources. As a result, companies need innovative modelling tools able to capture, investigate, and quantify the results of these changes and to work on the strategic planning, design, implementation, and management of their industrial symbiosis networks. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the most used modelling approaches to analyse industrial symbiosis, and to research their characteristics in terms of simulation methods, interaction mechanisms, and simulations software. Findings from our research suggest that an Agent-Based System Dynamics hybrid approach is an appropriate method for industrial symbiosis design and analysis. The paper also presents a theoretical framework that aims at supporting researchers and practitioners approaching industrial symbiosis and, in conclusion, a research agenda is suggested for scholars.

AB  - This study presents a proof-of-concept focusing on sustainable crowdfunding models for renewables as alternatives to conventional financing instruments and proposes a Philanthropic-Crowdfunding-Partnership (PCP) model. In this regard, this research investigates social welfare by evaluating the change in wealth inequality for the future time horizon by simulating conventional and the PCP financing models on solar farms in the case study of Turkey. The motivation is to find a solution for financing regional development in a holistic approach considering society and the environment to accomplish sustainable development. Furthermore, it also aims to provide insights into innovative public-private partnerships to unlock new horizons for development by incorporating citizen participation at large. The PCP model's objective is to mobilize capital throughout the public by prioritizing individuals along with small and medium enterprises over the large corporates in fundraising for renewable energy projects, mainly solar farms. This paper provides quantitative evidence that the PCP functions as a sustainable and alternative financing model by dramatically reducing wealth inequality. Besides, the PCP holds the potential to become a self-sufficient financing mechanism for projects ranging from small ones to mega initiatives.

AB  - Resource input is the prerequisite to maintain the operation of socio-economic systems. Exergy analysis provides a wide and clear vision of the use and degradation of natural resources, with essential implications to sustain ability. This paper aims to perform an exergy-based system account of the resource utilization in China, one of the most complex societies around the world. An overall systems diagram with seven independent and complimentary social departments is designed to illustrate the clear-cut processes of resource use and exergy destruction and loss. The national total input of resource exergy in 2012 reached 158.11 EJ, with the net input of 155.87 EJ. Its per capita resource consumption increased to 111.95 GJ, compared with 51.5 GJ in 2003. Industry accounted for 26.3% of the total resource exergy consumption, followed by Conversion 23.2%, Household 18.3%, Agriculture 10.2%, Tertiary 10.0%, Exaction 6.7% and Transportation 5.3%. The sectoral conversion coefficients of resource exergy were estimated as 91.92% for Extraction, 34.58% for Conversion, 29.75% for Agriculture, 32.18% for Industry, 18.46% for Transportation, 34.28% for Tertiary and only 1.28% for Household. The structure and efficiencies of resource exergy use of the Chinese society haven't witnessed a prominent improvement in the recent decade, and its resource utilization performance was still inferior to those of some industrialized societies. Exergy-based unified accounting for a benchmark year provides solid foundation for resource policy formation and can serve as the tool for identifying resource footprint and sustainable development mode.

AB  - There is an urgent need for policies to close the existing financing gap for civil infrastructure. However, identification of the desired scenarios for the closure of the financing gap is complex because there are many factors that affect investment in infrastructure. Thus, comprehensive models are required to (1)simulate the impacts of policies, and (2)identify the highly likely scenarios for desired policy outcomes. The objective of this paper is to create a simulation model for ex-ante analysis of financing policies in highway transportation infrastructure in the United States. Using the agent-based technique, this model simulates the microbehaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Using the output of the simulation model, financing landscapes of the U.S. transportation infrastructure are developed. The simulated landscape is shown to be helpful in identifying the highly likely scenarios leading to a high level of investment in highway transportation infrastructure under the existing infrastructure investment structures and budget constraints in the United States. The study presented in this paper is novel with respect to (1)the application of the system-of-systems modeling in the analysis of transportation infrastructure financing policies, (2)identification of the desired policy scenarios and their likelihoods for closure of the financing gap in the presence of uncertainties and adaptive behaviors, and (3)simulation and visualization of the impacts of financing policies at the state and national levels. The model promotes a data-driven policy analysis and provides policymakers with a tool to simultaneously account for the impacts of several factors and uncertainties.

AB  - As the human influence upon its environment accelerates, it is becoming urgently apparent that this influence must be modulated in some fashion for the benefit of both our environment and our selves. But just how should we modulate and regulate this influence, especially when we are increasingly aware of the vast complexity of our environment and our selves. Indeed, we are trying to make rational decisions in the face of overwhelming information overload. We are trying collectively to adapt to this new status quo, as we grapple with the concepts of sustainability and ecosystem health.
   A potentially powerful guide to such adjustments is found under the guise of CAHSystems analysis (Complex Adaptive Hierarchical Systems). This chapter offers a variety of perspectives on the pluralistic emergence of complex systems knowledge and their environmental applications. In particular, a critical need in such an analysis is the useful measurement of the organizational complexity of CAHSystems. In what follows, some of these approaches and their implications are illustrated. What is both promising and exciting is that there are premonitions of the integration of these approaches into a more unified body of a CAHSystems Theory. A second need that is also treated in this chapter is the development of a more rigorous and coordinated modeling approach to serve as a medium of comprehension and application. A final need is the direct integration of human ethical-social-political-economic systems into the decisionmaking process in the form of social learning and polycentric integrated assessments, rational allocation of resources for remediation attempts and the development of more global 'eco-ethics' that can go beyond the purely reductionistic modulation and regulation of our environment and our selves.

AB  - We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms' investments and households' house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate.

AB  - China's rapid urbanization has produced a number of resources and environmental problems, making it necessary to provide a scientific basis for the promotion of sustainable urbanization. This study integrates systems theory with complexity science to create an Urbanization-Resources-Environment complex system (URE) to assess the sustainability of urbanization, beginning by conjoining a theory of urbanization and ecological environment coupling. We developed a comprehensive coordinated development index for URE (URECDI) to represent the internal connectivity and influence between the urbanization, resources and environmental subsystems, and also indicate the sustainability of urbanization. This study analyzed trends observed in URE for 13 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region (JJJ) of China, using statistical data collected from 2005 to 2015. The main results are: (1) urbanization efficiency, resource utilization efficiency and environmental quality are the largest influences on the indices, which indicates that they are key factors in the behavior of URE; (2) coordination between subsystems of URE within JJJ was not good, but showed an increasing trend during 2005-2015; and (3) URECDI indicated significant differences between 13 cities, which suggests that we can increase coordination within URE by implementing a zoning strategy, and adjusting policies and investment to favor low-coordinated cities. The coordinated development index can reveal the overall characteristics of URE and ensure regionally sustainable urbanization.

AB  - The excessive energy consumption, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction problems have gradually become huge obstacles for the development of societal-economic-natural complex ecosystems. Regarding the national ecological-economic system, how to make explicit the resource accounting, diagnose the resource conversion, and measure the disturbance of environmental emissions to the systems are the fundamental basis of sustainable development and coordinated management. This paper presents an extended exergy (EE) accounting including the material exergy and exergy equivalent of externalities consideration in a systematic process from production to consumption, and China in 2010 is chosen as a case study to foster an in-depth understanding of the conflict between high-speed development and the available resources. The whole society is decomposed into seven sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Extraction, Conversion, Industry, Transportation, Tertiary, and Domestic sectors) according to their distinct characteristics. An adaptive EE accounting database, which incorporates traditional energy, renewable energy, mineral element, and other natural resources as well as resource-based secondary products, is constructed on the basis of the internal flows in the system. In addition, the environmental emission accounting has been adjusted to calculate the externalities-equivalent exergy. The results show that the EE value for the year 2010 in China was 1.80 X 10(14) MJ, which is greatly increased. Furthermore, an EE-based sustainability indices system has been established to provide an epitomized exploration for evaluating the performance of flows and storages with the system from a sustainability perspective. The value of the EE-based sustainability indicator was calculated to be 0.23, much lower than the critical value of 1, implying that China is still developing in the stages of high energy consumption and a low sustainability level.

AB  - Pakistan is a resource-constrained country, poor in municipal and healthcare facilities. Existing healthcare structures in the country are often overcrowded, and an effective monitoring and assessment of their sustainability is therefore crucial. In this study, a systemic approach is outlined to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the largest and sole public hospital in the major city of Gujranwala, in the Punjab region of Pakistan. The Emergy (spelled with "m") Accounting (EMA) method is applied. Its operationalization allows to keep track of the amount of energy that was consumed in direct and indirect transformations to make a product or service. Relevant data include the hospital requirements in terms of energy, water, products, labor, and services. The EMA results offer a supply-side geobiosphere-oriented perspective. Emergy indicators show that the hospital is indirectly responsible for a significant stress on the environment, that might be decreased by an increased efficiency in the resource use. On the other hand, a hospital is a complex system, depending on skilled laborforce as well as on several fine imported medical products and related services, making it dependent on external socio-economic systems. The presented results address the geography dependent characteristics of the hospital, and can be used for benchmarking and future evaluation of similar hospitals within and across the region.

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) are poised to disrupt travel patterns and the sustainability of transportation networks. Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility.

AB  - Faced with the degraded ecological environment, it is necessary to optimize the energy structure and interregional energy trade framework to achieve sustainable and balanced development. A RIMSP-based energy structure balance development model is proposed to solve the contradictions among energy consumption, economic system cost, and ecological emissions. In this study, the systemic risks and uncertainties are considered through integrating the Conditional Value at Risk module, Interval Programming, Multi-Stage stochastic Programming, and Integer Programming. A typical region with unbalanced energy endowments and economic development, Shanxi Province, China was investigated to illustrate the model applicability and superiority. It is found that the probability of system failures can be controlled within 1% and the most stable energy system will be found when risk weighted coefficient at 20. The optimal power generation schemes can be obtained for target power generation stage with compensation mechanism and for recourse power generation stage with substitution ratio of 20%, 15%, and 10% at three planning periods, respectively. The total installed capacity of clean energy is expected to reach approximately 41.4% by 2035. Wind power and solar power have more advantages than natural gas power in responding to flexible power demand and long-term sustainable requirements. In addition, the emissions of Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxide, and Carbon Dioxide would be reduced to varying degrees. The results can provide a solid scientific basis for formulating balanced development policies to restore the ecological environment related to energy consumption.

AB  - Low coral islands are heavily dependent on groundwater for freshwater supplies. The availability, quality, and management of groundwater are central to sustainable development and poverty alleviation in many developing small island nations. The declaration by the Government of Kiribati of water reserves on the atoll of Tarawa, over privately owned land, has lead to conflicts, illegal settlements and vandalism of public assets. Beside, the water consumption per capita tends to increase towards western-like standards, threatening the sustainability of the actual exploitation system. Finally, pollution generated by the 45 000 habitants of South Tarawa has already contaminated all the freshwater lenses, with the exception of the existing reserves so far.
   Our project, called AtollGame, aims at providing the relevant information to the local actors, including institutional and local community representatives in order to facilitate the dialogue and devise together sustainable and equitable water management practices. Multi-Agent Based Simulations (MABS) coupled with a Role-Playing Game have been implemented to fulfil this aim.
   They have the potential to greatly reduce conflict over natural resource management and resource allocation. In order to collect, understand and merge viewpoints coming from different stakeholders, the following 3-stage methodology is applied: collecting local and expert knowledge, blending the different viewpoints into a game-based model, playing the game with the different stakeholders in order to explore different scenarii and their simulated outcomes.
   Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage of the project is characterised by the upheaval of contradictory Government stands that undermine the whole process. It is argued that heterogeneous viewpoints may be handled in a satisfactory manner during the gaming sessions, but that long-term hidden agendas may override the outcomes. Beyond the inherent question of legitimacy attached to such approaches, it is clear, from our experience, that some players - especially those representing Government or supra-national institutions - have to deal with constraints that are often genuinely first considered as external to the on-going negotiation process.

AB  - In recent years, several global events have severely disrupted economies and social structures, undermining confidence in the resilience of modern societies. Examples include the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought unprecedented health challenges and economic disruptions, and the emergence of geopolitical tensions and conflicts that have further strained international relations and economic stability. While empirical evidence on the dynamics and drivers of past societal collapse is mounting, a process-based understanding of these dynamics is still in its infancy. Here, we aim to identify and illustrate the underlying drivers of such societal instability or even collapse. The inspiration for this work is Joseph Tainter's theory of the "collapse of complex societies", which postulates that the complexity of societies increases as they solve problems, leading to diminishing returns on complexity investments and ultimately to collapse. In this work, we abstract this theory into a low-dimensional and stylized model of two classes of networked agents, hereafter referred to as "laborers" and "administrators". We numerically model the dynamics of societal complexity, measured as the fraction of "administrators", which was assumed to affect the productivity of connected energy-producing "laborers". We show that collapse becomes increasingly likely as the complexity of the model society continuously increases in response to external stresses that emulate Tainter's abstract notion of problems that societies must solve. We also provide an analytical approximation of the system's dominant dynamics, which matches well with the numerical experiments, and use it to study the influence on network link density, social mobility and productivity. Our work advances the understanding of social-ecological collapse and illustrates its potentially direct link to an ever-increasing societal complexity in response to external shocks or stresses via a self-reinforcing feedback.

AB  - The ultimate goal of the FuturICT Flagship is to understand and manage complex, global, socially interactive systems, with a focus on sustainability and resilience. Revealing the hidden laws and processes underlying societies constitutes the most pressing scientific grand challenge of our century. Integrating the three components of ICT, Complexity Science and the Social Sciences will lead to a paradigm shift, facilitating a symbiotic co-evolution of ICT and society. Data from our complex globe-spanning ICT system will be leveraged to develop models of techno-socio-economic systems. In turn, insight from these models will inform the development of a new generation of socially adaptive, self-organised ICT systems.
   FuturICT as a whole will act as a Knowledge Accelerator, turning massive data into knowledge and technological progress. FuturICT will create the scientific methods and ICT platforms needed to address planetary-scale challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. Specifically, FuturICT will build a sophisticated simulation, visualization and participation platform, known as the Living Earth Simulator. This platform will power Observatories, to detect and mitigate crises, and Participatory Platforms, to support decision-making for policy-makers and citizens.
   In the Coordination Action Pilot Study which is running from May 2011-April 2012, activities will take place to develop the scientific vision and roadmap, secure stakeholder commitment, establish the FuturICT legal and operational infrastructure, and build on our remarkable success in uniting previously fragmented research communities. The main aim of the activities throughout the project will be to refine the FuturICT vision and identify measureable milestones along the way. This will produce an ambitious large-scale, science-driven, visionary research initiative to promote and develop future research outcomes in ICT. Through these activities, the Coordination Action will allow Europe to grasp this unique opportunity for groundbreaking progress in science and ICT, with great impacts for society, governance and industry by launching the FuturICT Flagship in 2013.

AB  - Establishing a holistic approach to manage floods and droughts is essential considering the different hydrological conditions. This work aimed to demonstrate how the integrated management of floods and droughts (IMFD) can increase sustainability and decrease the vulnerability of reservoirs against water-related disasters. To do so, a non-integrated management of floods and droughts (NMFD) is compared to an IMFD approach for the optimal operation of a reservoir (Doroudzan dam) to evaluate the sustainability of each scenario, especially the environmental water demand for Bakhtegan lake. Doroudzan dam provides water for different users, especially the environmental water demand. The IMFD and NMFD are differentiated through the development of industrial activities and the construction of a new regulatory dam, respectively. Each management scenario is tested under three hydrological conditions, i.e., dry, normal, and wet, which are determined by the standardized runoff index (SRI). Additionally, in the IMFD scenario, optimal cropping patterns are proposed to farmers by policymakers to increase water use efficiency. The heterogeneity in farmers' response to adopting these cropping patterns is simulated through a well-known behavioral theory, prospect theory (PT). A novel optimization algorithm, NSGAIII, is utilized to determine the optimal operation of the reservoir and a bankruptcy scenario is utilized to share released water from the reservoir between the involved stakeholders. Results show the superiority of the IMFD scenario against the NMFD scenario in terms of decreasing water shortage as well as agricultural and environmental vulnerability, especially in dry conditions due to implementing more sustainable solutions. The average annual financial wealth generated by the IMFD scenario is greater than that of the NMFD scenario by about 68% through development in the industrial activities as a more profitable sector. Also, the utilization of PT shows how downstream and upstream farmers behave distinctly towards policymakers' recommendations because they have different viewpoints about the amount of available water.

AB  - The challenge of information control of complex systems has been studied especially pre & PRIME;cised during the last years due to the increased level of digital transformation. The integrated nature of modern economic systems requires advanced solutions based on combination of state-of-the-art digital techniques with revised classical managerial, economical and mathematical approaches. The research gap is emphasized with the less of literature sources devoted to practical aspects of such combined tools applications. On this issue the authors suggest the algorithmic framework with analytical model on information control enhancement to transport-related operations within complex transportation systems. The article proposes a model of total transportation time (TTT) estimation considering various restrictions, elasticity coefficient of customer satisfaction, sustainable development and social aspects. As a result of better information control, transportation system becomes more flexible for alternative solutions. It explains the high applied value of the conducted research aimed also on planning improvement through the precise control procedures in transportation systems. Holistic view on the problem of TTT definition through the prism of information integration brings the discussion forward on how many factors should be considered in planning and controlling of integrated transportation systems. The given numerical example for multimodal international conveyance highlights the role of the proposed algorithmic foundations towards information management and control in multi-object systems. Probabilistic estimation of process reliability corresponds to the need of planning agile transportation systems.The purpose of the study is to contribute to the research field of stochastic on-time arrival (SOTA) problem with consideration of many factors influencing on performance in integrated transportation systems. The algorithmic framework proposes a conceptual basis for management, planning and information control. Application of the proposed methodology helps obtaining higher probability of on time arrival and increase reliability of transportation systems.

AB  - Three independent literatures have contributed to the understanding of irreversibility in economics. The first focuses on the future opportunities forgone by investments with irreversible consequences. The second considers irreversibility (and hysteresis) in the context of the dynamics of systems characterized by multiple equilibria. The third, with roots in complex systems theory, focuses on entrainment-a phenomenon recognized in economics as lock-in or lock-out. This paper disentangles the different strands in the economic analysis of irreversibility in order to identify the core ideas involved and to connect them to arguments in the parallel literatures on sustainability and uncertainty.

AB  - The concept of sustainability, and especially sustainable development, is among the most ambitious and controversial concepts in the scientific literature. Knowledge and research concerning the condition, development or transformation of sustainability has become not only the original means of the generation of socio-economic science knowledge. It is also an alternative for the analysis of especially sophisticated development problems - e.g. the problems of survival, effective change and avoidance of huge losses pertaining to such complexes as cities, countries or regions. Finding the ways of such knowledge conversion into the field of science is complex, but there is no alternative. Research of sustainable development has already become especially prevalent, and, thus, the objects of cognition should be structured, possibilities should be consolidated, and the efficiency of the use of resources must be elevated. The first challenge of sustainability research conversion into the sustainability science is a thorough mastering of the systemic research technologies, as well as the development of the principal methodology of systemic research while evolving the possibilities of civilisation survival on Earth.
   The objective of the research is to find an adequate quantitative measure of complex system development sustainability and investigate in detail the type of development of a small country or region that could be named as a realisation of sustainable development possibilities. The methodology of the research includes the application of an adequate portfolio model, stochastic optimisation, and systemic analysis. The conclusions obtained by the research state that development possibilities of a small country should not be evaluated only in terms of economic-ecological aspects; more components, such as politics, integration, marketing, social-demographics, creativity, religion, innovation, finance, and investment should be included, which could be logically divided into four subsystems of country universal sustainability. The research also presents the adequate composition of efficiency and reliability of the general effect pertaining to the activity of all the subsystems, as well as the optimal allocation of marginal investment unit among the four subsystems.

AB  - Purpose With the macroprudential approach, systemic risk is explained by a general equilibrium (GE) model. However, since on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet (OBS) risks are structurally segmented, for example annually or periodically on financial statements, the GE model might need further integration with OBS risks including ecological shocks. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a theoretical two-period model with consumption, investment and loans, which further includes carbon emissions to distinguish between loans for "green" or "brown" firms to enhance the perspective of ecological sustainability. Findings The paper shows how the environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors might be of relevance in the standard bank capital regulatory structure. In dealing with ecological sustainability, a new methodological framework with the green K-index introduces penalties to be paid in the capital structure related to ESG factors. The model is enhanced for screening green or brown firms related to impact investing. The integrated view of financial stability and ecological sustainability further illuminates how a wide cross-sectoral resilience of a green K-index measure for the economy might be achievable. Research limitations/implications A stock-flow consistent model with balance-sheet methods raises the question whether all necessary variables and parameters can be computed in practice. Compared to the agent-based model (ABM), this model additionally lacks inputs from agents' behaviour, thus non-rational decisions, which may be relevant in practice. More generally, by adopting a balance-sheet structure, the model shows a coherent framework with relevant variables. The methodology of the GE model with OBS has not been scholarly explored and thus is presented for discussion rather than generalisation. The GE model with OBS provides a new interpretation of systemic risk and interbank relations with a consideration of ecological aspects. Its economic implication contributes to contemporary banking theory as well as to the sustainability discussions in the larger financial sector. Practical implications Banks and investors can more carefully measure the ecological risks in their loan portfolios and make better informed decisions leading to a better sustainability of the financial markets. Originality/value This study develops a theoretical GE model with off-balance-sheet risks. The model adds green regulation enhancing the capital regulation framework relevant to sustainability. This, in turn, enhances the role of banks in a coherent economic framework for loan decisions towards a much greener finance.

AB  - By overlaying terrestrial and marine perspectives, we examine complex system change at the local scale of the southern Cape and Agulhas Bank in South Africa through placing different knowledge bases on climate variability alongside each other. This research adds insights into how social components of complex systems interact with environmental change and contributes to confirming environmental regime shifts in the research area; identifying knowledge disconnects for ecosystem services linked to terrestrial water availability; and highlights scale disconnects in fisher observations in near- and off-shore change. The benefits of examining these diverse bodies of knowledge in parallel across terrestrial and marine systems are evident in the synergies and disconnects that emerge from our integrative approach. Although impossible to eliminate uncertainty around projected climate variability and change, this multi-evidence base strengthens advice for evidence-based, strategic decision making that is locally relevant. The methodology pursued adds to the global learning on overlaying multiple bodies of knowledge in support of sustainability.

AB  - Public infrastructure is an interdependent system of actors, organisations, assets, services, the society it serves, and the context of each and their whole. This complexity presents research challenges for those focused at the system level, not the least that there is limited research in whole-of-system working for public infrastructure administration and the public sector more generally. Although the available literature appears unified in calling for a probing, pluralist approach, there are few examples of how to approach complex systems in practice. This paper derives from a research programme on the strategic intent and management of infrastructure systems. That programme used the New Zealand land transport system as its focus; nonetheless, it should have wider application given the shared issues being faced within infrastructure practice and matters of sustainability, resilience and system fitness more generally. By melding methods, the action research methodology is aimed at assisting researchers of complex systems and/or problems in gaining more fulsome insights and evidence to support theory. Accordingly, the methodology contributes to the understanding of how to approach infrastructure systems from a research perspective. It offers a road map, a means of sense-making and socialising the issues found at the whole-of-system level and a systemic diagnostic tool.

A theoretical framework of industrial development quality (IDQ) was constructed, and 32 influencing factors were selected based on complex system theory. The IDQ in Xi' an from 2004 to 2019 was evaluated, and the influencing mechanisms of each IDQ factor were analyzed through an integrated maximum generalized information entropy (MGIE)-self-organizing feature mapping (SOFM) neural network-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)-interpretive structural modeling (ISM) approach. The results show that the IDQ in Xi' an is on the rise, but the development of internal subsystems is uneven, with the technology subsystem contributing the most and the social subsystem contributing the least. There is a multi-layer hierarchical structure among the influencing factors of IDQ, and the multi-layer structure model can be divided into 10 layers. The first layer is the investment intensity of industrial pollution control, which is the most direct factor that affects IDQ. The tenth layer is the industrial wastewater discharge intensity, industrial waste gas emission intensity, water consumption per unit of industrial added value, highway density, and energy consumption per unit of industrial added value, which are the root factors affecting IDQ. This study can provide a theoretical basis and reference for the promotion of high-quality industrial development.

AB  - Balancing the relationship between population and environment is crucial for urban sustainability nowadays. Research on the coordinated development of population and environment from the perspective of city size is relatively scarce. This study constructed a comprehensive evaluation system for demographic and environmental systems. It applied a relative development index, a modified coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, an obstacle degree model, and a two-way fixed effects model to explore the development trends, coupling coordination relationships and influencing factors of the Population-Environment (P-E) complex system in 35 metropolitan cities in China from 2006 to 2022. The results indicated that (1) the development levels of population and environment had generally improved, and there were significant disparities in the population development level among cities of different sizes; (2) population development lagged behind environmental development, though they became gradually synchronized; (3) the CCD of P-E complex system increased with city sizes; (4) major factors influencing P-E coordination included population reproduction, environmental investments, aging and migration. Larger-scale cities like megacities should prioritize to mitigate population aging, narrow urban-rural income gap, strengthen pollution control, and balance gender structure. Smaller-scale cities can focus on optimizing industrial and employment structures. These findings provided suggestions to promote urban coordinated, high-quality and sustainable development.

AB  - The coal city is a complex system composed of the subsystems such as population, resource, economic and environment. Sustainability in the coal city depends on the reasonable structure, development pattern of each subsystem and their effective adjustment. The concept of sustainability and the simulation method of system dynamics were combined, the system dynamics model for the coal city was built on the analysis of its' structure. The adjustment parameters such as procreate index, investment ratio of industry and resource recycling rate etc, were confirmed. The typical coal city of Jixi is taken as an example; five future development patterns were designed and run on the model. The simulated results indicate that the sustainable development pattern is the best development pattern for Jixi comparatively.

AB  - The relationship between resilience and vulnerability has been a focus in social-ecological systems (SESs) and disaster risk reduction (DRR), and different outcomes have been found. Some scholars argue that resilience and vulnerability are isolated concepts due to their epistemological origin, while others note the existence of a strong resilience-vulnerability relationship. In summary, there is academic debate about 1) resilience as an antonym of vulnerability, 2) resilience as a factor of vulnerability, and 3) resilience as related to but different from vulnerability. Here, we present an analytical framework based on the dynamic resilience-vulnerability interaction throughout the adaptive cycle of complex systems and disaster process phases. To this end, the evolution of resilience and vulnerability concepts is briefly reviewed. This review shows that resilience can be measured as an outcome in terms of recovery or as attributes composed of absorptive, adaptive, and transformative capacities. Resilience attributes influence vulnerability before, during, and after the disaster, whereas vulnerability influences resilience only after the disturbance when it is measured as an outcome. Our proposal exposes households as SESs whose capital assets are elements that contribute resilience attributes to the system, such as diversity, connectivity, and thresholds, that together constitute the absorptive capacity. We conclude that more than a linear or straightforward relationship, resilience and vulnerability have a dynamic interaction that changes along with the adaptive cycle of SESs and the phases of disasters.

AB  - Long term uncertainties in combination with long lifetime of assets of drinking water infrastructures (DWIs) and changing expectations of stakeholders make strategic decisions in drinking water infrastructures (DWIs) complex. A framework with building blocks and design spaces was developed to support these decisions. Building blocks, divided in governance and system properties, were generic resilience enhancing design principles found in literature. The design spaces were defined by characteristics (water quantity, water quality and environmental impact), and the scale dimension. The DWI design principles framework was operationalised in a case study. The case showed that the DWI design principles framework was useful for strategic issues and the results were recognised and accepted by a diverse group of stakeholders. It may also be possible to apply the framework for other water infrastructures with comparable characteristics and dimensions.

CP  - 45th International Seminar on Nuclear War and Planetary Emergencies
AB  - Arguably, the most acute energy emergency today is associated with the rapid growth of cities, most notably in Asia and Africa. The populations of all cities are growing rapidly, and two-thirds of the global population will live in large cities by 2050. Economic, political, and social entities are important elements of cities, which are complex systems in themselves, but energy issues tend to be afterthoughts. Energy in itself is a large and complex system and is the "glue" that holds an entire city system together, and energy must be integrated equally into the mix, in planning as well as execution. Energy's full integration provides an opportunity to substantially contribute to discussions and lead to city solutions going forward, and by extrapolation to the sustainability of the entire planet. Issues such as energy-efficient technologies, policies, regulations and their enforcement, energy services, and communication all need to be part of the solution. These problems are amenable to the new science of modelling and controllability of complex networks, with a real promise of new insights and the identification of unanticipated patterns and key control points using statistical physics and non-linear dynamics.
   In working on energy and cities, it is important to interact with the entities already involved in other parts of the system. Productive interactions logically begin with the mayors of cities. Public-private partnerships already exist and the private sector must be engaged. The financial community is critical and capital investment firms must also be involved. Last but not least, national governments have a role to play by offering long-term technology development and financial incentives.

AB  - Thousands of years of progress in urban development led to complex urban environments that can be considered as complex systems. The management of complex systems must account for uncertainty, unpredictable future states and nonlinear behaviour. In this context, digitalisation can play a key role in the development of innovative tools to support strategic decisions and emergency management. In particular, the management of university building stocks can be facilitated with the creation of digital environments.
   In the Italian case, university campuses are often complex assets composed of widespread buildings and the management process is still based on fragmented databases handled by different administrative divisions resulting in a lack of information among stakeholders.
   The integration between Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) is already making some steps towards the creation of a digital model of the city. The combination of BIM-GIS with a platform for the data management is the base to develop an Asset Management System to exploit Business Intelligence (BI) tools for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) in smart campuses.
   This research aims to integrate BIM, GIS and BI tools in a digital framework for the development of an AMS and web-based application for the improvement of the experience among users and the optimal use of resources. A real case study is proposed for the development of the research project, namely the University of Turin building stock, in Italy.

AB  - Urban infrastructures, to fully take advantage of future investments, must first be recognized as interconnected complex systems of systems. This forum paper describes research and education needs that, if properly addressed, could prepare the civil engineering profession to meet the new challenges of urban infrastructure renovation. Among the needs, the objective documentation of the life-cycle performance of constructed systems could leverage novel sensing systems and advances in computer science, tools often untapped by civil engineering programs. Other needs and opportunities involve the design process, perhaps the most important milestone in the development of civil engineers. The topics and needs discussed in this paper could becomecore curriculum areas in newly developed postgraduate and eventually in undergraduate programs. The authors hypothesize that, if the integration of such topics is successful, civil engineers could become true protagonists of the rejuvenation of the US urban infrastructures and future stewards of cities and megacities.

AB  - This paper explores to what extent moving towards the 30% GHG emission reductions by 2020 with respect to 1990 in the EU can be considered a transformative target. To do so, we first define the concept of transformative targets from a complex systems perspective and show a novel approach and original results using an extended application of the GEM-E3 model. Traditional macroeconomic models cannot easily handle key synergetic system effects derived from green growth and sustainability policies, and thus require additional features. We analyse the role of semi-endogenous growth driven by learning-by-doing and low-carbon investment expectations following a long-term transformative trajectory.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a topic of national concern as our standing assets and future forests are important to our livelihood. Many tree species are predicted to decline' or disappear while others may be able to adapt or migrate. Efforts to quantify and disseminate the current condition of forests are urgently needed to guide management and policy. Here, we develop a new indicator to summarize raw density-independent mortality of forested stands by species from the last decade of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century using forest inventory data. We define density-independent mortality to be stand mortality by species due to processes unrelated to natural mortality from succession or stand maturation, which is marked by overall increase in tree girth at the expense of density of individuals. We assess trends for 22 species on national forests in two U.S. states, Washington and Oregon. Populations of some species including timber species have no or low overall levels of density-independent mortality (Juniperus occidentalis, Abies procera, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii). In contrast, other species demonstrate unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality (Pinus monticola, Arbutus menziesii, Pinus albicaulis, Abies lasiocarpa, Taxus brevifolia, Pinus contorta, Abies grandis, Picea englemanii, and Larix occidentalis). Additionally, the net potential for unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality in standing populations does not necessarily warrant concern when examined across species for our study area and time period; however, when examined by species, the number of species in decline exceeds the number of species where mortality can be generally attributed to endogenous self-thinning. We argue that this work can aid management and policy decisions and our understanding of complex vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. Application of the indicator at larger spatial scales and in conjunction with data on migration and establishment may be used to address questions such as, how can we make cost-effective management decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of tree species and forests? Tree species distributions across the landscape are complex systems, and raw characterization of current trends occurring in forest inventories is important especially given the uncertainty associated with the modeling and prediction of complex systems such as tree species.

AB  - The relationship between the energy-food-water nexus and the climate is non-linear, multi-sectoral and time sensitive, incorporating aspects of complexity and risk in climate related decision-making. Current methods of analysis were not built to represent such a complex system and are insufficiently equipped to capture and understand positive and negative externalities generated by the interactions among different stakeholders involved in the energy-food-water nexus. Potential amplification effects, time delays and path dependency of climate policies are also inadequately represented. This paper seeks to explore how knowledge co-production can help identify opportunities for building more effective, sustainable, inclusive and legitimate decision making processes on climate change. This would enable more resilient responses to climate risks impacting the nexus while increasing transparency, communication and trust among key actors. We do so by proposing the oper-ationalization of an interdisciplinary approach of analysis applying the novel methodology developed in Howarth and Monasterolo (2016). Through a bottom-up, participative approach, we present results of five themed workshops organized in the UK (focusing on: shocks and hazards, infrastructure, local economy, governance and governments, finance and insurance) featuring 78 stakeholders from academia, government and industry. We present participant's perceptions of opportunities that can emerge from climate and weather shocks across the energy-food-water nexus. We explore opportunities offered by the development and deployment of a transdisciplinary approach of analysis within the nexus boundaries and we analyse their implications. Our analysis contributes to the current debate on how to shape global and local responses to climate change by reflecting on lessons learnt and best practice from cross-stakeholder and cross-sectorial engagement. In so doing, it helps inform a new generation of complex systems models to analyse climate change impact on the food-water energy nexus

AB  - Urban mobility is currently undergoing three fundamental transformations with the sharing economy, electrification, and autonomous vehicles changing how people and goods move across cities. In this paper, we demonstrate the valuable contribution of decision support systems that combine data-driven analytics and simulation techniques in understanding complex systems such as urban transportation. Using the city of Berlin as a case study, we show that shared, autonomous electric vehicles can substantially reduce resource investments while keeping service levels stable. Our findings inform stakeholders on the trade-off between economic and sustainability-related considerations when fostering the transition to sustainable urban mobility.

AB  - Purpose The authors discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate and incentivize reform in corporate social responsibility (CSR), i.e. governance with regard to pledge for socially responsible investments (SRIs). Design/methodology/approach The current essay examines the impacts of AI systems on the dynamics between corporate governance and financial markets in terms of promoting sustainability. Based on a qualitative review of over 100 pieces of literature, we offer an outlook into the mentioned dynamics through the lens of complex systems. Legal and ethical provisions for safe and robust AI systems are briefly discussed and integrated. Findings In a closed system, there is a reinforcing feedback loop between SRI and CSR. AI is a moderator to increase SRI and a mediator to incentivize CSR. If the legal and ethical provisions are involved in the AI systems, they could act as catalyst for corporate governance reform towards sustainability. Research limitations/implications The findings are based on a solely qualitative assessment of the prior literature in corporate governance, corporate law, AI and data governance, asset pricing, and asset allocation. The scopes and specifics of the relationship are yet to be found through quanatitative or quantitative/qualitative hybrid methods.

AB  - As a social and environmental-sensitive industry, garment firms are trying to implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) to cope with the increasing pressure of public concerns for globalised socially responsible supply chains (SC). We build such a model by using the System Dynamics (SD) approach. With the mechanism of mutual interactions between different variables of a complex system, our study examines different conditions of CSR implementation in the SC under which it is profitable for SC actors. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that when CSR implementation can stabilise market demand, firms' CSR investment is beneficial. Our study provides a theoretical and managerial foundation that may be used to strengthen the consideration of CSR engagement in the garment SC. By analysing the covariance of factors influencing decision making to implement CSR strategies, our approach allows SC managers to make CSR decisions and production management. Furthermore, the model provides tools for evaluating and forecasting the effectiveness of their CSR strategies according to industry specifics.

AB  - Displacing fossil fuels and their derivatives with renewables, and increasing sustainable food production are among the major challenges facing the world in the coming decades. A possible, sustainable direction for addressing this challenge is the production of biomass and the conversion of this biomass to the required products through a complex system coined biorefinery. Terrestrial biomass and microalgae are possible sources; however, concerns over net energy balance, potable water use, environmental hazards, and uncertainty in the processing technologies raise questions regarding their actual potential to meet the anticipated food, feed, and energy challenges in a sustainable way. Alternative sustainable sources for biorefineries are macroalgae grown and processed offshore. However, implementation of the offshore biorefineries requires detailed analysis of their technological, economic, and environmental performance. In this chapter, the basic principles of marine biorefineries design are shown. The methods to integrate thermodynamic efficiency, investment, and environmental aspects are discussed. The performance improvement by development of new cultivation methods that fit macroalgae physiology and development of new fermentation methods that address macroalgae unique chemical composition is shown.

AB  - In recent years, smart technologies and networking solutions, such as Internet of things (IoT), have been adopted by most leading cities in China as ways to revitalize economic opportunities and strengthen their global resilience to climate change. This paper presents the concept of the smart city, which serves as a complex system by integrating sensors, data, applications, and organizational forms to make cities more agile and sustainable when faced with global climate changes. The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of smart city initiatives in China in recent years. Six key conceptual dimensions of smart city practices are classified: energy, agriculture, transport, buildings, urban services, and urban security operations. Chinese smart city policy and practices explore renewable energy and resources, increase public convenience, and make cities more comfortable and citizen friendly. Critical concerns are explored in such areas as integration (within the urban system, with other cities), governance, innovation, and finance. Finally, a policy vision is outlined to build up public-private collaborative networks, to encourage more innovations and investments in smart city initiatives, and to put more emphasis on smart services.

AB  - The energy sustainability of blockchains, whose consensus protocol rests on the Proof-of-Work, nourishes a heated debate. The underlying issue lies in a highly energy-consuming process, defined as mining, required to validate crypto-asset transactions. Mining is the process of solving a cryptographic puzzle, incentivized by the possibility of gaining a reward. The higher the number of users performing mining, i.e. miners, the higher the overall electricity consumption of a blockchain. For that reason, mining constitutes a negative environmental externality. Here, we study whether miners' interests can meet the collective need to curb energy consumption. To this end, we introduce the Crypto-Asset Game, namely a model based on the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory devised for studying the dynamics of a population whose agents can play as crypto-asset users or as miners. The proposed model, studied via numerical simulations, reveals a rich spectrum of possible steady states. Interestingly, by setting the miners' reward in the function of the population size, agents reach a strategy profile that optimizes global energy consumption. To conclude, can a Proof-of-Work-based blockchain become energetically sustainable? Our results suggest that blockchain protocol parameters could have a relevant role in the global energy consumption of this technology.

AB  - This article explores the emergence of leadership during implementation of a water saving initiative in the rural community surrounding Barren Box Swamp in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. Qualitative data analysis indicated that the system elements affecting the type of leadership to emerge included the extent to which the groups were engaged in the process, the level of access to resources, and the level of investment in the outcomes of the project. Although these results reinforced key aspects of complex problem-solving through collaboration, they demonstrated varying degrees and types of both engagement and leadership within the case community. Given the current finding that these varying elements can coincide within one system, this case suggests that each community's characteristics, resources and context will determine the optimal combination of leadership style and level of collaboration needed to facilitate sustainable community development.

AB  - Transformative governance is an approach to environmental governance that has the capacity to respond to, manage, and trigger regime shifts in coupled social-ecological systems (SESs) at multiple scales. The goal of transformative governance is to actively shift degraded SESs to alternative, more desirable, or more functional regimes by altering the structures and processes that define the system. Transformative governance is rooted in ecological theories to explain cross-scale dynamics in complex systems, as well as social theories of change, innovation, and technological transformation. Similar to adaptive governance, transformative governance involves a broad set of governance components, but requires additional capacity to foster new social-ecological regimes including increased risk tolerance, significant systemic investment, and restructured economies and power relations. Transformative governance has the potential to actively respond to regime shifts triggered by climate change, and thus future research should focus on identifying system drivers and leading indicators associated with social-ecological thresholds.

AB  - Renewable energy is an inexhaustible source of energy because it is constantly renewed by natural processes. Renewable energy is derived from natural phenomena mainly sun (radiation), moon (tide) and earth (geothermal). There is also energy generated from the water and the wind. All these renewable mentioned sources are called new energies. Renewable energy technologies transform these natural sources into several forms of usable energy, most often electricity but also heat, chemical and mechanical energies. Renewable energy technologies are called "green" or "clean" because they pollute little or nothing of the entire environment. The use of renewable energy hybrid power plants allows any country to develop its energy independence and security. Nevertheless, these resources are weather and location dependent, leading to the intermittent and randomness of their use for energy production. The hybrid power plant production fluctuates independently from demand, yielding to an energy excess for some power plants while others cannot satisfy their minimal needs. Since the production of renewable energy is expensive due to the high cost of both the installation of renewable energy power plants and the storage devices, the optimal solution is to avail from the produced quantity of this energy by maximizing its use and consequently minimizing its loss. Many attempts have been made in the past decade to enhance, generalise and mainly optimise the use of renewable energy using different technologies, including metaheuristics (Piccolo & Siano, 2009; Senol et al., 2016; Kumawat et al., 2017; Etxeberria et al., 2010; Niknam & Firouzi, 2009; Soroudi, Ehsan & Zareipour, 2011) for an optimal DGs
   Fossil fuels are the most used resources mainly to power homes and cars, i.e., in 2017, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the world electricity. For a country, it is convenient to use coal, oil or gas energy sources to meet its energy needs, but these fuel sources are often limited. In addition, the intensive use of these energies causes dangerous consequences of the environment, mainly the phenomenon climate change (Dincer, 1999; Goldemberg, 2006). The burning of fossil fuels sends greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, polluting air, soil and water while trapping the heat of the sun and contributing to a global warming. Other traditional energies use biomass which designates the organic waste that can become a
   Energy is at the basis of any social or economic development. The fossil energy is the most used energy source in the world due to the cheap building cost of the power plants. In 2017, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the world electricity. Since, on the one hand, these plants produce large amount of carbon dioxide which drives climate change, and on the other hand, the storage of existing world fossil resources is in continuous decrease, safer and highly available energy sources should be considered. Hence, for human well-being, and for a green environment, these fossil plants should be switched to cleaner ones. Renewable energy resources have begun to be used as alternatives. These resources have many advantages such as sustainability and environmental protection. Nevertheless, they require higher investment costs. In addition, the reliability of many planted systems is poor. In most cases these systems are not sufficient to ensure a continuous demand of energy for all in needy regions because most of their resources are climate dependent. The main contributions of this research are (i) to propose a natural formalisation of the renewable energy distribution problem, based on COP (Constraint Optimisation Problem), that takes into consideration all the constraints related to this problem; (u) to propose a novel multi-agent dynamic (A-RESS for Agent based Renewable Energy Sharing System) to solve this problem. The proposed system was implemented and the obtained results show its efficiency and performance in terms of produced, consumed and lost energy.

AB  - Critical infrastructure behaves as a complex system with many interacting parts, geographically distant subsystems, distributed control, evolutionary development and emergent behavior. This research aims to review the ongoing transformation of critical infrastructure systems, with a focus on identifying factors influencing system changes and the gaps in understanding increasing system interconnections and interdependencies. In this research, critical infrastructure systems incorporating cyber and human-social characteristics have been mapped using a water utility example. The research found that rapid technology advancements, increasing dependencies on data and analytics, changing community expectations and attitudes to sustainability, equality and public health and adaption due to climate change and natural disasters are transforming these systems, increasing interconnections. With increasing interconnections and interdependencies, these large physical asset systems are becoming cyber-physical-human systems. Consequently, existing studies in the literature do not provide an effective understanding of the complex interactions of system components, emergent behaviors and points of evolving risk in such cyber-physical-human critical infrastructure systems. New safety, security and resilience challenges are emerging in the ongoing transformation, which requires better understanding to enable earlier identification of potential risks.

AB  - A model for simulating resource flows in a rural subsistence community is described. The People and Landscape Model (PALM) consists of a number of agents representing households, the landscape, and livestock. The landscape is made up of a number of homogeneous land units, or 'fields', each represented by an object containing data, methods and properties relevant to the field. Each field object consists of a number of soil layer objects, each of which contains routines to calculate its water balance and carbon and nitrogen dynamics. Organic matter decomposition is simulated by a version of the CENTURY model, while water and nitrogen dynamics are simulated by versions of the routines in the DSSAT crop models. The soil processes are simulated continuously, and vegetation types (crops, weeds, trees) can come and go in a field depending on its management. Crop growth and development are simulated by a generic model based on the DSSAT crop models, and which can be parameterised for different crops. Similarly, livestock growth and resource use is simulated by a generic model which can be parameterised for buffalo, cows, goats, sheep, chickens and pigs. Each household agent has stores of food, cash, fertiliser, fodder, seed, labour, manure, milk and meat, and also maintains dynamic lists of the patches and livestock units it has access to. Various types of household can be accommodated, ranging from resource-poor to resource-rich. Household agents can also communicate and exchange messages with one another and with the agents representing the landscape and livestock. Decision-making occurs on the basis of the internal state of each household agent and on its perception of the outside world gained from the information received during communication with other agents and the environment. Decisions result in activities being carried out by the household, which in turn influence the flows of water, carbon, nitrogen, labour, and finance-activities can be transactions, involving money, such as purchase of food, or actions, which do not include money, such as application of fertiliser to a field. The model uses object-oriented concepts with multiple instances of various sub-models being possible, so that, for example, different crop models (or even the same one) can be run simultaneously in different fields with different parameters (e.g. planting dates, etc.) for each instance. The advantages of using an agent-based approach as a way of integrating the biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of a system is discussed.
   The model was used to simulate a community of households each of which were allocated one of seven strategies of crop nutrient management, with these strategies competing with one another over the period of the simulation, during which soil fertility slowly declined. Unsuccessful strategies, determined by the returns generated in relation to an 'aspiration level', were replaced by more successful strategies. The impacts of agents requiring farmyard manure being allowed to purchase from agents with a surplus of manure was also investigated. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, a significant revolution has begun in social entrepreneurship, with public funding organizations and private investors beginning to pursue social purpose. At the heart of the revolution is the ambition of these entities to use innovation and entrepreneurship to sustain and scale impacts in support of social and environmental objectives. This article provides a framework that conceptualizes social innovation and finance as a multi-level and evolving complex system. Two trajectories of transformation,niche-regimeandwithin-regime, are used to frame a broad range of examples of impact entrepreneurship and social financing. Social finance is viewed as the key to release the 'lock-in' of social innovation, as it is able to gather and coordinate capital, resources, knowledge and ability. Using meta-analysis, the article explores the characteristics, dynamics and ecosystem of social innovation, impact entrepreneurship in China. The study maps the landscape of social finance in China and estimates there are untapped social finance opportunities worth from US$93 to US$208 billion.

AB  - The driving force of super-gentrification shapes a complex system in which multiple dynamic factors interact with each other. This paper takes the dynamic factor system of super-gentrification as the research object and uses the Interpretative Structure Modeling (ISM) to analyze these dynamic factors. The levels of these dynamic factors and the interaction between them are determined. The Cross Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC) analysis is also conducted to determine the dependence power and driving power of these dynamic factors. Through analysis, it is concluded that the dynamic factors of super-gentrification are distributed on six levels. Among these dynamic factors, Transformation of Industrial Structure and Occupational Structure in Urban Central Areas, Housing Needs of Overseas Elites, Investment Needs, Development of the Real Estate Market, and Unique Areas and Lifestyle Preferences are the fundamental dynamic factors affecting super-gentrification. The findings of this paper can enrich the existing theoretical research on the driving force of super-gentrification and can provide a reference for policy makers to promote urban landscape sustainability to some extent.

AB  - Leverage points from systems research are increasingly important to understand how to support transformations towards sustainability, but few studies have considered leverage points in strengthening adaptive capacity to climate change. The existing literature mainly considers strengthening adaptive capacity as a steady and linear process. This article explores possibilities to fast track positive adaptive capacity trajectories of small-scale farmers in the Northern Region of Ghana. Leverage points were identified by triangulating data from semi-structured interviews with farmers (n=72), key informant interviews (n=7) and focus group discussions (FG1 n=17; FG2 n=20). The results present two ways to approach adaptation planning: 1) using four generic leverage points (gender equality, social learning, information and knowledge, and access to finance) or 2) combining the adaptive capacity and leverage point frameworks, thereby creating 15 associations. The generic points provide a set of topics as a starting point for policy and intervention planning activities, while the 15 associations support the identification of place-specific leverage points. Four benefits of using leverage points for adaptive capacity in adaptation planning were identified: guidance on where to intervene in a system, ability to deal with complex systems, inclusion of both causal and teleological decision-making, and a possibility to target deep, transformative change.

AB  - In the theory of urban development, the evolutionary perspective is becoming dominant. Cities are understood as complex systems shaped by bottom-up processes with outcomes that are hard to foresee and plan for. This perspective is strengthened by the current turn towards smart cities and the intensive use of digital technologies to optimize urban ecosystems. This paper extends the evolutionary thinking and emerging dynamics of cities to smart city planning. It is based on recent efforts for a smart city strategy in Thessaloniki that enhances the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of the city. Taking advantage of opportunities offered by the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge, the Rockefeller 100 Resilient Cities, the World Bank, and the EU Horizon 2020 Program, Thessaloniki shaped a strategy for an inclusive economy, resilient infrastructure, participatory governance, and open data. This process, however, does not have the usual features of planning. It reveals the complex dimension of smart city planning as a synthesis of technologies, user engagement, and windows of opportunity, which are fuzzy at the start of the planning process. The evolutionary features of cities, which until now were ascribed to the working of markets, are now shaping the institutional aspects of planning for smart cities.

AB  - Processes in inter-organizational projects tend to be complex to coordinate. Within these projects, stakeholders have to make decisions together, despite a limited awareness of the other parties' interests and views. Frequently, coordination in inter-organizational projects is ineffective and inadequately addressed, despite the investment of considerable effort, which often results in delays and/or unwanted project outcomes. The purpose of this study is to investigate how a shared problem understanding for inter-organizational decision making can be achieved by means of sustainable coordination. In this study, CIMO logic was used to explore the context of the organizational change, followed by the application of design science research in order to develop an intervision process. The findings of this study are twofold. To manage the complex problem context, additional efforts were needed in order to create awareness of the team's coordination activities. The application of the concept of co-designing resulted in a higher degree of sustainable relational coordination. The resulting intervision process aided the team in gaining a shared problem understanding of the decision making process in the inter-organizational project. The use of the co-designed intervision process can potentially be employed for other complex systematic problems, such as those occurring in the construction industry.

AB  - The implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation policies depend on the development of green technologies whose diffusion is constrained by a number of barriers which prevent them to spread broadly and at a fast pace. By means of an agent-based computational model, the paper investigates the macro and micro economic dynamics considering the role of a "traditional" commercial bank and a state investment bank that explicitly supports green investments. Simulation results emphasize that green finance matter and that the market diffusion of environmental innovation is more pronounced when the presence of the public investment bank is combined with strong consumers' preferences oriented towards environmental quality. The relevance of the paper is twofold. Besides contributing to the literature on the finance-innovation nexus by considering the role of climate finance within a complex systems framework, it provides a model that can be used as a tool to explore policies to foster environmental innovation diffusion.

AB  - The SBSC (sustainability-balanced scorecard) is adapted for the evaluation of the performance of airports to ensure sustainable development. The approach aims to integrate this performance evaluation of sustainable development, and use qualitative and quantitative information with the sustainability-balanced scorecard. The multiple criterion decision making model was first used to estimate the key influences of international airport performance in relation to sustainability. We first used the DEMATEL (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory) to establish a complex system illustrated as an influential-network-relationship-map. We next used the DANP (DEMATEL based on analytical network process) to confirm the influential weights. Then, we used a hybrid modified VIKOR to select and improve the performance gaps between the aspiration values and the current situation for the international airport. To demonstrate the proposed model, we applied it to three international airports in Taiwan as a case study. The outcomes indicate that airport image is the most crucial factor within the performance evaluation and that social perspective has the highest degree of net influence. The largest weighted gap when examining the aspiration value is public transport for the A(2) airports and transparency of finance for the A(1) and A(3) airports. The implications for management are discussed.

AB  - Meeting its climate policy objectives requires the UK to rapidly decarbonise its energy sector. This demands high levels of investments into low carbon energy infrastructure, which are currently not undertaken at required scale, leading to a green finance gap. We explore (1) key investment barriers, (2) a theoretical framework for investigation and (3) possible solutions, drawing on a review of academic literature and policy reports, and interviews conducted with financial investors and experts. Our study confirms that policy uncertainty and short-termism in the financial system are the two main investment barriers. Our results show that identified barriers form a complex system characterised by path-dependency, lock-in and non-linearity. We recommend the adoption of systems theory as an analytical framework to inform the related policy debate and propose the expansion or development of sustainable investment vehicles as a useful near-term solution while preparing a long-term policy intervention based on a systems perspective.

AB  - Transportation projects, such as those for maritime ports, airports, passenger rail and freight rail are typically large investments and they can be a complex system that includes multiple modes, new technologies, operating concepts, and operators. These projects are initiated by metropolitan planning organizations, city port authorities, and statewide department of transportation agencies and others. Architectural or engineering services firms are often contracted to assist with the project planning steps. The planning processes include evaluating and ranking alternatives with subjective and quantitative criteria. Additionally, as projects evolve, there is a need to gain stakeholder approval and conduct environmental impact reviews. Simulation modeling provides a unique and flexible framework to assist with concept development, stakeholder consensus building, and public approval during environmental impact reviews. Modeling provides the ability to quantify concept performance differences between alternatives and demonstrate that a concept provides operational sustainability for each of the stakeholders and modal flows. This paper describes several transportation planning projects and how simulation modeling can provide quantitative performance metrics to support the planning processes to enable the project to move towards advanced design and engineering stages.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Sustainability defines itself with preserving the natural resources, while maintaining a sustained rate of economic growth. Latin American countries are rich in natural resources and this has created an opportunity in exploiting the resources in order to gain economic advances. In particular, the newly rising economic powers in the region are attracting international investments in their oil exploration and production industries. Brazil, Venezuela and Columbia in South and Mexico in North America are among the largest Latin American oil producers of the world.
   On the other hand, the increasingly concerning effects of the climate change phenomena has drawn significant attention towards methods of controlling the roots of the problem. An important cause as confirmed by the historic emissions data is the man-made Greenhouse Gas emissions resulting from excessive use of fossil fuels, and more importantly the carbon-intensive coal and oil. In this paper, we investigate the possible impacts of an emission control system on Latin American oil producers to control the rate of emissions through a financial market which is referred to as the carbon market. Variations of this system has successfully been implemented in the Europe and some states of the US, such as the state of California. Our approach is based on the system dynamics methodology where the main factors of a complex system are extracted and their causal relations are exploited to obtain mathematical models that can explain the behaviors of overall system. The general tools provided by the system dynamics approach for policy testing makes it very appealing for our purpose which is to test the effect of a carbon market on the Latin American producers. We extend our previous models to fit the Latin American economies focusing on the sustainability issues.

KW  - common pool resources
KW  - fiscal resiliency
AB  - Public employee pension management is the nexus of public and private financial management systems that are significant long-term components of public finance. The idea that these pension systems can look quite similar yet perform in quite different and conflicting ways is significant when designing policy; system design templates are not successful in complex systems. Even pension systems within the same city can have radically different states of actuarial health based upon small differences in the rules (or adherence to the rules) establishing them. To better understand such systems, viewing them from a common pool resource perspective is useful. Elinor Ostrom (1990), in her seminal book Governing the Commons, provides eight principles that facilitate governing common pool resources. The general theme running through Ostrom's principles is the need to facilitate the building and channeling of social capital. By facilitating constructive collective choice, the goal of effective, sustainable collective action is achievable. In this study, we examine the political, cultural, and institutional structures that are in place in the pension systems of Dallas and Houston, Texas. We examine the pensions' governance practices to determine which appear to violate Ostrom's ideal institutional arrangements and their impact on the pensions' long-term sustainability. Pertinent survey information from pension beneficiaries conducted as part of this research are provided

AB  - Insights in the field of cybersecurity economics empower decision makers to make informed decisions that improve their evaluation and management of situations that may lead to catastrophic consequences and threaten the sustainability of digital ecosystems. By drawing on these insights, cybersecurity practitioners have been able to respond to many complex problems that have emerged within the context of cybersecurity over the last two decades. The academic field of cybersecurity economics is highly interdisciplinary since it combines core findings and tools from disciplines such as sociology, psychology, law, political science, and computer science. This study aims to develop an extensive and consistent survey based on a literature review and publicly available reports. This review contributes by aggregating the available knowledge from 28 studies, out of a collection of 628 scholarly articles, to answer five specific research questions. The focus is how identified topics have been conceptualized and studied variously. This review shows that most of the cybersecurity economics models are transitioning from unrealistic, unverifiable, or highly simplified fundamental premises toward dynamic, stochastic, and generalizable models.

AB  - The research aims to provide a new approach and insights into the nexus between economic growth and green energy by analyzing their direct, indirect, and total linkages at the European Union level (EU-27). To this end, an advanced empirical analysis performed by network analysis, as Gaussian Graphical Models, is carried out for the period 2012-2022 The originality of network analysis lies in the fact that it allows the simultaneous visualization of all the links between variables in a complex system of dependencies. The novelty of the paper is twofold: first, it addresses the issue of renewable energy in an innovative way that captures three key stages of the EU policy (renewables' capacity; share of renewable energy; and final consumption); second, it advances the nexus analysis by considering technological investments. Empirical results have validated the vital role of increasing the share of renewable energy in achieving sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Also, the Research & Development and Gross Value added in environmental goods and services sector are found to positively influence sustainable development. The results are useful for policymakers and managers of organizations to understand the relationships between these variables better and thus, achieve climate neutrality.

AB  - Biogas has been earmarked as one of the leading renewable energy sources capable of mitigating environmental emissions in rural areas. Thus, developing an accounting technique is of particular importance in coping with increasing problems related to renewable agriculture and rural energy supply. In this study, extended exergy was generalised for the sustainability evaluation of biogas projects. Furthermore, a series of extended exergy-based indicators was presented as benchmarking from the perspectives of resources, economics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The sustainability of a "Three-in-One" biogas production system in southern China was thereby evaluated based on the proposed framework. The results show that economic costs concentrate in the construction phase. GHG emissions are mainly derived from bricks and cement, with proportions of 36.23% and 34.91%, respectively. The largest resource depletion occurs during the consumption of feedstock (87.06%) in the operation phase. Compared with other renewable energy conversion systems, the biogas project has a higher renewability (0.925) and economic return on investment ratio (6.82) and a lower GHG emission intensity (0.012). With the merit of bridging thermodynamics and externality, the extended exergy-based approach presented in this study may effectively appraise the energy and environmental performance of biogas projects.

AB  - The present article is an attempt to perceive the universal sustainability observable in an individual country or region, where the religious, political, social-demographic, economic, environmental, creative, technological and investment subsystems are revealed not only through the vitality of spiritual and material existence media, but rather through the signs of the development of these subsystems as self-assembled units through the erosion of their interaction. The problem of optimal allocation of investment resources among the separate sustainability's subsystems was addressed by means of expert methods and techniques of portfolio methodology which will enable the achievement of the enshrined universal sustainability standards. A country-specific index composition of sustainability subsystems' indices was chosen as the universal sustainability index for the specific country. The index in its dynamics is perceived as a random process. While projecting its state and evaluating its power, i.e., the impact of the subsystem efficiency in a particular moment, this power is measured by the level of the index and the reliability or guarantee of an appropriate level. To solve the problem of investment resources allocation, the idea of Markowitz Random Field was invoked in order to reach the maximum power of sustainability index while applying the technical solution-the so-called "GoldSim"system. Engineering is a methodology that aspires to reveal the core attributes of complex systems and instruments in order to manage the possibility to influence these properties for the systems. Experimental expert evaluation and case study is performed on Lithuanian data.

TI  - Big Earths of China: Remotely Sensing Xinjiang along the Belt and Road
T2  - CRITICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
AB  - Undergirding China's Belt and Road Initiative's lofty promise of global connectivity are existing connections between the PRC's implementation of planetary-scale observation systems for environmental sustainability and the recognizably nefarious policies of localized, colonial surveillance of Turkic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). My article examines how the recently alleged genocide in XUAR becomes the afflicted topos where both the rhetoric and practices of monitoring differently complex systems come together. Such complex connections require a recursive analysis, one which further distinguishes between recursion as an actual technique used in remote sensing and algorithmic processes and recursion as a heuristic in discourses about these computational processes and their effects on controlled populations and territories. This article, following recent interest in the intersections of geopolitics, computational design, digital capitalism and colonialism, argues that the Chinese government's multipronged investments in environmental sciences-related sensing and imaging technologies do not simply help track its own citizens and foreign populations but also how these groups are increasingly monitored by them. I examine how the Digital Belt and Road's Science Plan frames the environment, including sovereign territories, peoples, and natural resources as data assets. The rest of my discussion turns away from state-sponsored Earth sciences to examine Anglophone media and human rights groups' use of satellite imageries and databases to evidence the state's construction of internment facilities and other surveillance mechanisms in XUAR. Alleged algorithms of oppression enclose the XUAR as a black box of the police state, but digital infographic interfaces like the Xinjiang Data Project, which attempts to expose the PRC's relegation of Uyghurs to biometric and surveillance data, only furthers a recursive datafication of XUAR.

AB  - The paper reflects on a transdisciplinary complex adaptive systems (T-CAS) approach to the development of a school health research network (SHRN) in Wales for a national culture of prevention for health improvement in schools. A T-CAS approach focuses on key stages and activities within a continuous network cycle to facilitate systems level change. The theory highlights the importance of establishing transdisciplinary strategic partnerships to identify and develop opportunities for system reorientation. Investment in and the linking of resources develops the capacity for key social agents to take advantage of disruption points in the re-orientated system, and engagement activities develop the network to facilitate new social interactions and opportunities for transdisciplinary activities. A focus on transdisciplinary action research to co-produce interventions, generate research evidence and inform policy and practice is shown to play an important part in developing new normative processes that act to self-regulate the emerging system. Finally, the provision of reciprocal network benefits provides critical feedback loops that stabilise the emerging adaptive system and promote the network cycle. SHRN is shown to have embedded itself in the system by securing sustainability funding from health and education, a key role in national and regional planning and recruiting every eligible school to the network. It has begun to reorient the system to one of evidence generation (56 research studies co-produced) and opportunities for data-led practice at multiple levels. Further capacity development will be required to capitalise on these. The advantages of a complex systems approach to address barriers to change and the transferability of a T-CAS network approach across settings and cultures are highlighted.

AB  - Various methods are used when building bankruptcy prediction models. New sophisticated methods that are already used in other scientific fields can also be applied in this area. Graph theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing and visualizing complex systems, making it a valuable tool for assessing the sustainability and financial health of businesses. The motivation for the research was the interest in the application of this method rarely applied in predicting the bankruptcy of companies. The paper aims to propose an improved dynamic bankruptcy prediction model based on graph theoretical modelling. The dynamic model considering the causality relation between financial features was built for the period 2015-2021. Financial features entering the model were selected with the use of Domain knowledge approach. When building the model, the weights of partial permanents were proposed to determine their impact on the final permanent and the algorithm for the optimalisation of these weights was established to obtain the best performing model. The outcome of the paper is the improved dynamic graph theoretical model with a good classification accuracy. The developed model is applicable in the field of bankruptcy prediction and is an equivalent sophisticated alternative to already established models.

AB  - The forest-based bioproduct field has diversified into the chemical, medical, energy, nanoproduct, and construction material sectors. This paper argues that forest-based bioeconomy has kept the focus on conventional products and new bioproducts have primarily been developed as extensions to existing product portfolios due to a lock-in mechanism, i.e., a state where an economy gradually locks itself to a dominant market position due to technical interrelatedness, economies of scale, and quasi-irreversibility of investment. The study examines forest-based product transition in the context of lock-in mechanisms through narrative analysis over the past 170 years. A theoretical framework is formulated based on complex system studies and the economics of lock-in mechanisms. The relation between the lock-in mechanisms of the regime and product diversification is described for the forest-based bioeconomy in Finland. The study supports previous findings indicating that interactions occur between the lock-in mechanisms. Furthermore, lock-in mechanisms can have a neutral, adverse, or beneficial effect on product diversification. The paper extends knowledge about the role and functioning of lock-in mechanisms in changing market environments. Recent trends in network development and foreign investment, and their effects on industrial symbiosis and product diversification, is recommendable to consider in future research.

AB  - City sustainability is a complex system affected by economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with the existence of interaction and conflict among factor. However, there is a lack of real methodology on the measurement of interaction. Then, this article presents a method to calculate the interaction among multiple criteria, including static interaction and dynamic trend similarity, and to compute the weigh coefficient of each indicator induced by this interaction. In addition, the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by evaluating the sustainability performance of 14 cities in Liaoning province China in the context of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. Our results show that the sustainable development of 14 cities in Liaoning province experienced dramatically downward and has a crucial condition from 2013 to 2017. Only Dalian, Shenyang, Panjin, Benxi, and Yingkou could be classified as a Good level (Level.), and none of cities was an Excellent level (Level.). From spatial-temporal perspective, regional disparities of sustainability are demonstrated by spatial distributions of city sustainability. In detail, the comprehensive sustainability and subsystem exhibit a "cold-spot in West" feature. The scores for indicators reveal that the shortage of science expenditure, declining investment in fixed asset, lack of economic growth, and lagging public transportation are the main limit factor faced by most cities. Meanwhile, tertiary industry development, energy efficiency improvement, increase green coverage, and reduce pollutant emissions are primary driving factors for improving sustainability. Comparing with other methods, MCDM considering interaction among criteria is an appropriate method to evaluate city sustainability.

AB  - The concept of the Water-Energy-Food nexus (WEF), as documented by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), suggests that the three resources are thoroughly interrelated, shaping a complicated web of interlinkages. Perceiving the three commodities as an interdependent variable system, rather than isolated subsystems is a step towards a more holistic approach, and thus a prerequisite to introducing a sustainable scheme for better managing resources. In this work, the well-documented WEF nexus is broadened to a five-dimensional nexus, also involving land use and climate. A methodology for drawing the interrelations among the five dimensions and unreeling the complicated system of direct and indirect interlinkages is given. The intensity of interlinkages among nexus components is initially assessed through a three-point typology with interlinkage scoring corresponding to resource use in Greece. The typology is used and is further expanded to quantify successfully all interlinkages among nexus components with a proposed heuristic algorithm. Results are used to create the cross-interlinkage matrix that identifies food as the most influencing resource and water as the resource mostly influenced by other nexus elements. Results show that indirect interlinkages of multiple resources can be very significant and should not be ignored when planning nexus-coherent policy initiatives and investments in different sectors, in order to promote resource efficiency.

AB  - In recent decades, various public policies have targeted agriculture and forestry's relationship with environ-mental protection and management. Among environmental policy communities the approach is increasingly framed through the theoretical concepts of ecosystem services (ES) or public goods (PG). Both offer useful perspectives to enhance understanding, but each only partially reflects the complex inter-linkages between productive land management and multiple environmental and social assets (biodiversity, landscapes, water, soil and air quality, rural vitality, culture and heritage), constraining their capacity for effective policy development. The Social-Ecological-Systems framework (SES), considering both natural and socio-economic elements in complex systems and interrogating these joint production relationships, offers added value in this context. The PEGASUS project1 applied an adapted SES framework to identify the potential complementary and synergistic roles of policy, private and community actors in promoting socially beneficial outcomes, strengthening ecosystem services and sustainability. Two case studies illustrate the analytical process and its ability to connect top down and bottom-up perspectives. This generated an expanded range of options focused on social processes and market development facilitated by an enabling, responsive policy framework. Lessons for governance and practice, as well as international relevance, are briefly considered.

AB  - This chapter stands for justification of growing demand for supporting new theoretical and methodological approaches in development of an actual green economy's financial framework taking into consideration modern growing risks in the ecological, economic, social, and geopolitical environments. A notable increase in environmental expenditures of both national economies and international financial institutions is determined by the global state of the economy. The climate change has been caused by escalating the energy supply struggle, the nature exhaustion, and the need for providing balance to the market stating green economy regulators. The main aim of this chapter is to study the trends and the key state green finance regulation points. The research goal could be achieved through highlighting the nature of green finance and its framework; studying the concept of green finance and innovative financial tools' development, providing green economy's development; and spotting trends and imperatives of regional regulation of green finance. This chapter highlights the necessity for implementing complex systemic and methodologic approaches in making the green finance framework, summarizing leading practices in green funding and green economy's funds raising, considering limits in green finance tools' utilization in current conditions, strengthening the power of both federal and regional authorities in solving financial problems of energy saving, and extending the practices of companies and institutions' green financial tools' utilization. The necessity for a green sustainable development across the globe has driven this research to use different types of instruments to point out the benefits of such a development. In addition, green finance state regulation tools have been proposed.

AB  - The European space-economy represents a complex system with a great internal heterogeneity, intensive socioeconomic interactions and differential growth trajectories among countries and regions. The present study aims to investigate the connectivity between spatial competitiveness and resilience in Europe and seeks to design an operational framework for concerted strategies of competitive and resilient regions. To assess the linkage between resilience and competitiveness, we have developed a new measure, viz. the Resilience and Competitiveness Index (RACI) as a function of two constituent sub-indices: Resilience and Competitiveness. This approach is tested on the basis of detailed data on European regions. The empirical results from 268 EU NUTS2 regions offer a solid anchor point for the proposed operational framework for concerted development strategies of competitive and resilient regions. Our research distinguishes and proposes several systematic types of concerted regional strategies according to the performance of a region measured by Resilience and Competiveness sub-indices. A key result of the study is the design of an operational constellation for strategic regional policy evaluation, with a major added value for policy- and decision-making purposes. The use of official data from Eurostat and of standard indicators in our research assures continuity and consistency with the official Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) classification and measurement, so that policy makers are able to compare the performance of their regions over time and to develop proper concerted strategies accordingly. The clear evidence of a connectivity between regional competitiveness and resilience may help to develop a governance approach that balances competitiveness (mainly represented by productive assets) with resilience (mainly represented by sustainability and ecological awareness) and thus to deal with the complexity in socioeconomic systems.

AB  - Rapid expansion, relative shortage resources supply and environmental impact threat the sustainable development of the smelting and pressing of metals sector. Fluxes of energy, materials, environmental remediation expenses, labor, and capital were quantified by Joules based on the second-law thermodynamics during years 1992-2015. The accounting method that quantifies the component of the extended exergy fluxes and the proportion in the total inputs was used to analyze this energy-intensive industry. Net per-capita exergy resource input and labor production efficiency are described the conversion of natural resource exergy to economic output and labor efficiency. The results showed the following: (1) the smelting and pressing of metals sector expands rapidly; the ferrous metals industry accounts the large part of the overall metals industry and the nonferrous metals industry grows faster than the ferrous metals industry. Natural resource exergy, especially energy exergy, dominates the investments of the metals industry. (2) Capital exergy and labor exergy decrease in the smelting and pressing of metals industry, while they increase in the nonferrous metals industry and decrease in the ferrous metals industry. Environmental exergy declines in both the nonferrous metals and ferrous metals industries. (3) The comparison of the nonferrous metals and ferrous metals industries with China as a whole, conducted by applying the two indicators for efficiency, shows that the two industries are exceeding the whole country in efficiency and have made great progress. In addition, the extended exergy analysis of smelting and pressing of metals industry is helpful in the identification of resource consumption and environmental cost in sustainable development view.

AB  - Bioeconomy has been incorporated into the national strategy for sustainable development by many countries, and the concept of biorefinery has been considered as one of the essential components of such strategies. The environmental, economic, and social implications of a biorefinery hinge upon both the endogenous interactions among its supply chain components and their responses to the exogenous factors. The system dynamics (SD) modeling approach is suitable for understanding such complex systems. This study provides a state-of-the-art review of the methodological assumptions of existing SD studies relevant to the sustainability of biorefineries. Among the reviewed studies, common supply chain components of a biorefinery were feedstock supply, biomass conversion, market demand, distribution, and use of bioproducts. Components of a supply chain are interlinked through feedback loops. For instance, the preference for bioproduct use increases the corresponding market demand, which attracts more investment in biorefineries and changes the supply of feedstock. Exogenous variables investigated by the reviewed studies cover the market demand, population growth, GDP change, imposed regulations and incentives to evaluate endogenous factors such as the price of biomass and biofuel, change in land-use pattern, and fuel or energy choices of consumers. Through analyzing the methodological assumptions, we also identified several limitations of the models/frameworks in the existing literature, including (1) the lack of a mechanism to represent the complex interactions within the supply chain of a biorefinery with a diverse product portfolio, and (2) the lack of feedback loops incorporating the environmental (e.g., via life cycle assessment), economic (e.g., via techno-economic analysis), and social (e.g., via social life cycle assessment) influences into the interactions among supply chain components. Accordingly, we proposed a recommendation for methodology development to address these limitations.

AB  - Resilience can have desirable and undesirable consequences. Thus, resilience should not be viewed as a normative desirable goal, but as a descriptor of complex systems dynamics. From this perspective, we apply resilience thinking concepts to assess the dynamics of inequality, spatial segregation, and sustainability in Chile's capital city of Santiago. Chile's economy boosted since democracy was restored in 1990, but continuity of neoliberal reforms and transformations of Pinochet's dictatorship (1973-1990) seem to have locked Chilean cities in resilient, albeit unsustainable, patterns of uneven development. Socio-economic data from Santiago shows highly resilient patterns of urban inequality and segregation from 1992 to 2009 despite democratic efforts, political agendas and discourses packed with calls for reducing poverty and inequality. We present a conceptual model based on the notion of stability landscapes to explore potential trade-offs between resilience and sustainable development. We mapped Santiago's spatio-temporal inequality trends and explored if these patterns support an inequality-resilience stability landscape. Analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of development assets across four human development dimensions (i.e., income, education, health, democracy) revealed potential socio-political and spatial feedbacks supporting the resilience of inequality and segregation in Santiago. We argue that urban sustainability may require breaking this resilience, a process where bottom-up stressors such as social movements could play a key role.

AB  - This work presents an application of the modern portfolio theory (MPT). The United Nations 2030 Agenda of sustainable development goals establishes 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 targets each associated with indicators, integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. This constitutes a complex system to be used by more than 150 countries having different priorities and levels of development. Concerning the 2030 Agenda Goals, MPT can help to define strategies to handle resource allocation problems. In economics, MPT appraises that when choosing a portfolio of assets looking for returns, some investors prefer fewer risks; others accept higher risks. To optimize the countries' path to sustainability, the decision makers may distribute their resources, acting similarly to an investor. In this case, an SDG corresponds to a portfolio and the assets to the indicators associated with a given Goal. Constructing an efficient frontier of optimal portfolios of assets, MPT provides a method to obtain the maximum possible expected returns for a given level of risk and, besides, the risks and expected returns involved in a weighting choice. The present work restricts the analyses to the indicators of Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), related to energy sustainability, for the five BRICS countries. This choice leads to an ensemble of situations that highlights the applicability of MPT to sustainability. Calculations are presented in detail for Brazil, and a general discussion is presented for the BRICS. The present approach considers the main features of a multi-criteria decision-making method, except the ranking of options by the decision makers.

AB  - Moving to a circular economy (CE) is crucial for achieving sustainability. However, many industries face challenges to make the transition. Industries function as complex systems, encompassing multiple business ecosystems (BEs) influenced by a myriad of market forces. Due to the absence of a single point of control, the evolution of industries and their BEs can follow various paths. If transitioning to a CE is a desired outcome, understanding the guidelines and restrictions - or 'rules' - that facilitate the emergence of circular BEs within industries is essential. This research therefore investigates the transition to a CE in the chemicals manufacturing industry through the lens of BEs, system theory, and orchestration theory. A two-stage instrumental case study was conducted, beginning with focus group discussions involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the chemical industry, followed by the analysis of a specific circular laundry detergent BE. Our findings deepen the understanding of CE, especially within the chemicals industry, by unveiling seven system rules that govern the transition. These rules emphasise the importance of motivations, challenges, cross-sector collaborations, and BE orchestration. Furthermore, our study highlights the consumers' readiness for circular value propositions and the pressing need for both private and governmental investment to scale up. Additionally, our findings shed light on the potential for synergies between highly carbon-intensive industries in the realm of CE. Despite the complexity of managing such intricate relationships, it is argued that fair distribution of gains and burdens can sustain circular BEs in the long run, which ultimately contributes to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.

AB  - In recent years there was a significant of international structures that are being created as platforms for multilateral policy dialogue on climate change issues outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Such structures are, for example, the Major Economies Forum (MEF), the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, the on Clean Energy Ministerial and a wide variety of partnerships. There is no common definition for such formats of cooperation and conceptual ground for understanding their place in international climate governance system. This includes both traditional interstate cooperation mechanisms embodied by the UNFCCC, as well as non-state initiatives, climate finance institutions, formats that support a constant dialogue between states, business representatives, academia, and NGOs on climate policy issues. The aim of the study was to clarify the nature of quasi-formal climate governance, to establish a typology and assess of the dynamics of development of quasi-formal entities to better understand the processes of its formation and implementation. I describe three types of quasi-formal entities from the new dataset of quasi-formal entities created in the period from 2001-2022: intergovernmental forums, UNFCCC party groupings, and hybrid partnerships. The study reveals an increase in the number of political forums and hybrid partnerships amid stabilization or even reduction of negotiating blocs within the UNFCCC. In complex system of international climate governance, quasi-formal entities are playing an increasing role in the accumulation and exchange of knowledge and experience between states on the implementation of the Paris Agreement.

AB  - Various types of 'bubbles', e.g. stock market, housing, dot.com, high-tech, historically, are commonly-observed phenomena in complex systems. Yet, their emergence often surprises people who remain unaware of history or their systemic roots. Bubbles are often considered to be simply the product of unwise speculative investments or social mania. Alternatively, conventional economic theories often consider factors, such as interest rates, to be the trigger. However, economic theories rarely account for the systemic structure of markets or for non-linear dynamics. The authors propose that special cases may emerge in some markets to trigger instability. Specifically, when minimal interest rates and capital requirements (down payments) are become extremely low a perceptual shift occurs among consumers such that they become viewed as approximate free goods. This paper proposes that unwise economic policies may activate a free goods scenario initiating a cascading series of destabilizing events leading to market collapse. The authors propose hypothesize that such incendiary policies caused both the 1929 stock market crash and the 2008 subprime housing crisis in the United States. To more deeply examine this claim, these policies were tested using a system dynamics model based on data from both the 1929 and 2008 crises. The model simulated and tested the effects of alternative rate policies on market dynamics. Some of the rates and down payments used in both crises set off tsunami-like shock waves through markets leading to their sudden collapse in these simulations. Based on the findings of this study, found that economic policies lessened market stability. The authors propose several revisions to these policies to foster greater market sustainability.

AB  - Pandemic events, particularly the current Covid-19 disease, compel organisations to re-formulate their day-to-day operations for achieving various business goals such as cost reduction. Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks. In the real-world case study, an accuracy rate of 82% is achieved, which indicates the potential of the proposed framework in assisting business sustainability pertaining to asset predictive maintenance under pandemic environments.

AB  - Construction assets are complex systems that require the analysis of a huge amount of data from materials and processes in order to perform a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Information from construction products and materials are usually provided with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which will be incorporated in LCA or Building Information Modelling (BIM) software for sustainability assessment purposes. This research studied digital EPDs available from Programme Operators, in order to identify the limitations for an automatic computer transfer of EPD-data into software tools without previous human interpretation of the content. Several implemented solutions were analysed, such as the international standard EN ISO 22057, the ILCD+EPD format, IFC or Smart CE. The research includes the evaluation of the scientific literature and the ISO, IEC and CEN/CENELEC standards related to sustainability assessment of buildings and infrastructures, EPDs or BIM. The study identifies limitations for computer-interpretability of digital EPDs, such as the definition of scenarios and the unique identification of the elements and performance characteristics. The discussion and conclusions assess the identified limitations and provide some preliminary solutions for future research. The results can be applied to other construction productrelated data and/or to EPD or LCA data from other sectors. The significance of this research relies on bridging the gap between digital EPDs and BIM, reducing the cost and time required for the LCA of built assets, supporting the application of science-based policies and the measurement of ESG indicators used by public and private organisations in relation to buildings and infrastructures.

AB  - Sustainability has for long been promoted as a medium for social and economic development, one that focuses on constant availability of natural assets and ecological amenities. By questioning the possibility of reaching a balanced and sustainable state of functioning for social-ecological systems, resilience improves the static framework of sustainability by acknowledging non-linear behavior of complex systems, inevitability of change, and consistent presence of uncertainty. At the core of sustainable development, environmental policy is embedded in the socio-spatial structures that constantly re-organize and breed uncertainty, such as political, economic, and climate uncertainty. These uncertainties create episodes of instability that shock the entire system including the structures of environmental protection. In this article, focusing on the aftermath of 2016 US presidential election and 2018 general election in Brazil, both broadly recognized as political shocks, we highlight the vulnerabilities of environmental protection structures to the rise of conservative populist movements. We attribute these vulnerabilities, partially, to the superiority of market-based instruments, as well as apolitical understandings of resilience under neoliberalism that overlook political instabilities and socio-spatial outcomes of neoliberal restructuring projects. In our assessment, political unpreparedness of sustainability against the right-wing onslaught in the US and Brazil further underlines the need for resilience theory to incorporate sources of political instability in order to protect the environment.

AB  - Flood risk is a global phenomenon affecting developed and less developed countries alike. Although developed countries are better equipped to handle the consequences of flood events due to investments in disaster risk reduction measures, less developed countries are struggling to cope with this challenge. This can be attributed to the complexities of managing floods while ensuring environmental sustainability, which are yet to be fully understood. As such, developing strategies to manage floods, adapt, and build resilience requires understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic, environmental, and infrastructural factors to promote policy development in sustainable flood risk management. System archetypes provide a framework for understanding complex system behaviour and assessment of intended and unintended consequences of policy actions. Using the coastal city of Limbe as a case study, this paper identified and analysed four key system archetypes that define flood risk management in Limbe;- 'fixes that fail', 'shifting the burden', 'limits to growth/success' and 'growth and under-investment'. Findings from the study underscore that policy availability does not directly translate to policy implementation and that Limbe's operational policies prioritise quick fixes for flood symptoms, often leading to unintended consequences, emphasizing the need for adaptive, flexible policies. Some leverage points are discussed to improve the sustainable management of floods and advocate for policies that consider long-term sustainability within its urban planning system, considering future urban and population growth to ensure sustainability in the short, medium, and long run.

AB  - The traditional definition of sustainability calls for policies and strategies that meet society's present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, U. S. policy formally established the goal of creating and maintaining "conditions under which [humans] and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans." However, we have not yet succeeded in making sustainability operational. The long-standing and current debates on setting energy policy, regulating greenhouse gases, and promoting alternate fuels illustrate the complexity of making sustainability operational. Achieving operational sustainability requires three critical elements: advances in science and technology, application of effective government regulations and policies, and green business practices. Not only are these elements necessary, all three must work together across the economy. A key lesson drawn from the history of environmental regulation and especially in the climate debate is that sustainability cannot be advanced without a convergence of government and business interests even when the requisite technology is available. The biofuel system presents an immediate and tangible test case for the successful interaction of these three critical elements. The massive investments in science and technology by both government and industry to develop new feedstocks and conversion methods are showing promise. From a regulatory perspective, existing statutes and new mandates impact all parts of the biofuel supply chain-a complex system involving feedstocks, conversion technologies, transport, storage, handling, and end use. Forward-looking businesses in the biofuel sector are integrating sustainability objectives into their business strategies, such as designing feedstock conversion processes to generate biofuel coproducts that can add substantial revenue. The combination and coordination of such activities have the potential to achieve sustainable biofuel production and to demonstrate the kind of critical approaches that are essential to making sustainability operational in this and other energy sectors.

AB  - Since the beginning of the well-drilling activities of oil and gas industry, in the 19th century, these activities have presented specific risks that, over the course of their evolution to the present day, have greatly increased their potential to cause harm to people, the environment, and corporate sustainability. Stimulated by the world's energy needs, especially in developed and growing countries, the technology used by the O&G industry has evolved significantly, not only to increase production and profit levels, but also to reduce the risks of these activities, using reliable automation and other barriers to worker protection. However, despite all this investment, accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon, in 2010, and Odebrecht NS-32, in 2017, shown that there are still gaps in this process of evolution of protection systems, especially those used in highly complex systems such as offshore oil rigs. In addition, inevitably, the technological contribution implemented in offshore drilling systems increases their complexity and, consequently, also increases the complexity of the relationship between workers, systems, machines, and environment, definitively characterizing oil rigs as complex socio-technical systems. Keeping that in mind, a FRAM model was developed to understand the levels of complexity and show the relevant human factors that are critical for the safe operations of these workplaces, considering the natural and variability that emerges from these labour scenarios. Some functions of the FRAM model built presented significant variability, as function "Perform drilling operations", where the most significant variabilities were observed in its 10 outputs, causing a large resonance within the model, once their couplings, mostly in their control aspects, can vary in terms of time and precision.

AB  - Many regular business operations are transforming into digital services, increasing advanced multi-platforms, rapid operational alignment, flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption, hardware waste, and technology investments. Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study's findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile's 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems' environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Worldwide, many developing countries are making efforts to achieve sustainability through the 17 SDGs and at the same time to contribute to environmental security. The Nexus approach enables a more integrated and sustainable use of resources that extends beyond traditional siloed thinking and is applicable at multiple scales. This is especially important in a globalized world where collaboration is becoming increasingly important for societies. In this framework, we present an analysis that will assist policymakers set priorities in investments by investigating the influence of the WEF nexus on the 17 SDGs and vice versa. Following the Nexus approach may thus enhance synergies and contribute to increased performance in connected SDGs that are positively influenced. In this article, we present an analysis that allows stakeholders to adapt it to their specific needs by entering new scores based on the characteristics of each case study; the results of this methodology should be considered in light of the specific conditions, including socio-cultural aspects and geographical, geopolitical, and governance realities, as well as the scale of the case study in question. A Fuzzy Cognitive Map analysis is also conducted on the scores to quantify SDG impact and identify the SDGs that most strongly "influence" nexus-coherent policies and the SDGs that are most strongly "influenced by" the nexus. This is achieved by analyzing the causality in this complex system of positive and negative interlinkages. Through this analysis, three SDGs, namely SDG 2 (Food), SDG 6 (Water) and SDG 7 (Energy), are indicated as the most influenced by the WEF nexus, revealing either synergies or trade-offs, while other SDGs are identified as having little interaction with the WEF nexus system.

AB  - This paper sets out the main findings from two rounds of interviews with senior representatives from the UK's urban development industry: the third and final phase of a 3-year pilot, Moving Health Upstream in Urban Development' (UPSTREAM). The project had two primary aims: firstly, to attempt to value economically the health cost-benefits associated with the quality of urban environments and, secondly, to interview those in control of urban development in the UK in order to reveal the potential barriers to, and opportunities for, the creation of healthy urban environments, including their views on the use of economic valuation of (planetary) health outcomes. Much is known about the 'downstream' impact of urban environments on human and planetary health and about how to design and plan healthy towns and cities ('midstream'), but we understand relatively little about how health can be factored in at key governance tipping points further 'upstream', particularly within dominant private sector areas of control (e.g. land, finance, delivery) at sub-national level. Our findings suggest that both public and private sector appeared well aware of the major health challenges posed by poor-quality urban environments. Yet they also recognized that health is not factored adequately into the urban planning process, and there was considerable support for greater use of non-market economic valuation to help improve decision-making. There was no silver bullet however: 110 barriers and 76 opportunities were identified across a highly complex range of systems, actors and processes, including many possible points of targeted intervention for economic valuation. Eight main themes were identified as key areas for discussion and future focus. This findings paper is the second of two on this phase of the project: the first sets out the rationale, approach and methodological lessons learned.

AB  - Energy security has become a worldwide issue in recent years. Coal resources security (CRS), an important part of energy security, has been an emerging concern in many countries, due to the diminishing fossil energy reserve and unbalanced energy structure. However, there is no universally agreed method of constructing indicator system for CRS assessment. Subjectivity in the process of evaluation also affects the results of assessment. Moreover, CRS is a complex system that should be evaluated scientifically under diverse methods. Therefore, we constructed an indicator system and evaluation model of CRS and used a case study of China and 31 provinces in its mainland to evaluate CRS at both national and provincial levels. The indicator system included two subsystems-long-term CRS and short-term CRS. We also chose a few elements and factors that are consistent with China's reality. Different research methods were used: the entropy-weight-based TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is applied to evaluate the degree of CRS, which avoids the subjectivity of weight determination and reflects the relative merit of each indicator; the BP (Back-Propagation) Neural Network method is used to analyze the sensitivity of CRS to each index. The results show that the national level of CRS dropped in the early years but slowly picked up with the help of government intervention. Investment in coal industry development resulted in the immediate effect of improving CRS. The positive impact of maintaining environmental sustainability is stable over either the short, medium, or long term. The degrees of CRS vary significantly across provinces, even between those with similar coal stock levels. Extra attention should be paid to the transportation of coal resources among provinces and intervention to balance supply and demand within the regions.

AB  - There are calls for researchers to study existing community assets and activities that appear to improve health and have achieved longevity. The TR14ers Community Dance Charity Limited is a community youth dance group that has been running since 2005 providing free weekly sessions for children and adolescents in an economically disadvantaged town in the UK. An in-depth case study employing qualitative, quantitative and participatory methods was undertaken with the TR14ers (current participants and those who have left, co-ordinators and families) over 6 months with the aim of understanding the sustainable processes and impact of the Group. The 12 complex systems' leverage points described by Meadows and the five domains of adolescent wellbeing developed by the United Nations H6+ Technical Working Group on Adolescent Health and Well-Being were used as frameworks to recognise the complexity of community assets like the TR14ers. The quantitative and qualitative data indicated that being part of the TR14ers contributed to multiple health and wellbeing outcomes. The positive experiences of being a TR14er led members to actively recruit others through word of mouth and public performances. Central to the TR14ers is a commitment to children's rights, which is communicated formally and informally throughout the membership informing how and what the Group does, leading to the structure and delivery of the Group evolving over time. Members sought to ensure the sustainability of the Group after they had left and were keen to mentor younger members to develop and become the leaders. Based on the insights from this case study we suggest that efforts to develop cultures of health, like the TR14ers, should focus on the core values of the activity or intervention that underpin what it does and how within the local context.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals express a narrative about the relationships between people and nature. This paper builds a narrative from an ocean perspective - through the lens of a coral reef seascape, and the blue economy. The ocean, intimately connected with the land, freshwater flows and climate provides a vast array of benefits to humanity. These benefits are valued at trillions of dollars per year globally, supporting hundreds of millions of jobs, and contributing to all countries both coastal and inland, through living and non-living resources, transport infrastructure and natural products, and sustainable energy solutions; the coastal zone is home to half the world's population. Through these direct benefits, the ocean contributes to reduced hunger and poverty, improved health, and all these benefits may be shared across gender, social and national boundaries. However accessing ocean benefits results in pressures that may drive decline in ocean health. Managing this complex system for a sustainable blue economy requires developing and using the right knowledge, new governance mechanisms and investment by stakeholders from global to local levels. This 'blue economy' narrative builds on the links between ocean health (SDG14) and economy (SDG8), but the general model can be expressed from the perspective of any goal(s) towards the others. The model also applies across scales from local to global, the relationships defined in the model enabling monitoring and assessment. The model can thus help align global instruments such as the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework with Agenda 2030, and linking from national to grassroots levels.

AB  - This study investigates the technical and economic feasibility of solar-powered adsorption cooling systems in Saudi Arabia, a region with high solar irradiance and growing energy demands for cooling. Given Saudi Arabia's reliance on energy-intensive cooling and its abundant solar resources, this study hypothesizes that solar adsorption systems can offer a sustainable solution to alleviate electricity demand for cooling in regions with rising energy needs. Using Polysun (R) 5.9 simulation software and real-world climate data from four major cities including Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, and Abha for the performance of two adsorption chillers, silica gel-water (ACS15) and zeolite-water (HTC11), was evaluated. The simulations reveal that a system utilizing 45 m2 flatplate solar collectors and an 8 m3 hot water storage tank can effectively reduce grid electricity consumption by up to 16,000 kWh annually, depending on the configuration and recooler type. The study highlights the superior performance of wet recoolers, particularly in arid climates like Riyadh, where the thermal coefficient of performance (COPth) increases from 0.35 to 0.43, while the electrical coefficient of performance (COPel) nearly doubles compared to dry recoolers. Economically, the system yields annual electricity savings of up to $1280, with a payback period of 22-26 years, which could be reduced to 15-18 years with government subsidies. Furthermore, the system contributes to sustainability by saving up to 9.41 barrels of oil equivalent annually. These findings demonstrate that solar-powered adsorption cooling systems offer a viable, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional vapor compression systems, especially in regions with abundant solar energy. Despite its technical promise, adsorption cooling remains limited in implementation due to high initial capital costs, complex system integration challenges, and relatively lower performance under extreme climatic conditions compared to conventional systems. However, the high initial investment costs require further reduction through technological improvements and government support to encourage broader adoption.

AB  - The paper investigates potential synergies and trade-offs between emission reduction policies and sustainable development objectives. Specifically, it provides an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, will have on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of poverty eradication (SDG1) and reduced income inequality (SDG10). Through this research we aim at answering the following questions: does mitigation policy always imply a trade-off with development objectives? If this is the case, what is the magnitude of the effect of the new international climate architecture on poverty and inequality? By combining an empirical analysis with a modelling exercise, the paper estimates the future trends of poverty prevalence and inequality across countries in a reference scenario and under a climate mitigation policy with alternative revenue recycling schemes. Our study finds that a full implementation of the emission reduction contributions, stated in the NDCs, is projected to slow down the effort to reduce poverty by 2030 (+4.2% of the population below the poverty line compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher policy costs. Conversely, the impact of climate policy on inequality shows opposite sign but remains very limited. If financial support for mitigation action in developing countries is provided through an international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly reduced at the aggregate level, but the country-specific effect depends on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on their economic structure. The output of our analysis contributes to the emerging literature on the linkages between climate change policy and sustainable development, although we capture only partially the complex system of interrelations and feedbacks proper of the SDGs. Moreover, due to its policy relevance, it further enriches the debate on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and its climate finance tools. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An integrated life cycle approach framework, including material flow analysis (MFA), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), exergy analysis (EXA), Emergy Assessment (EMA), and emissions (EMI) has been constructed and applied to examine the energy efficiency of high speed urban bus transportation systems compared to conventional bus transport in the city of Xiamen, Fujian province, China. This paper explores the consistency of the results achieved by means of several evaluation methods, and explores the sustain ability of innovation in urban public transportation systems. The case study dealt with in this paper is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system compared to Normal Bus Transit (NBT). All the analyses have been performed based on a common yearly database of natural resources, material, labor, energy and fuel input flows used in all life cycle phases (resource extraction, processing and manufacturing, use and end of life) of the infrastructure, vehicle and vehicle fuel. Cumulative energy, material and environmental support demands of transport are accounted for. Selected pressure indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the public transportation system. Results show that Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) shows much better energy and environmental performance than NBT, as indicated by the set of sustainability indicators calculated by means of our integrated approach. This is because of the higher efficiency of such modality (less affected by traffic, higher vehicle occupancy, suitability for large distance transportation). The study suggests that the higher economic and resource investments performed in order to provide dedicated roads, more modern transport technology and higher speed, translated into a better use of resources and lower environmental pressure, also because of the attraction of an increased number of passengers, who would have otherwise used car transportation modalities. This study also provides a clear evidence that more than one criterion is needed to address a fully reliable and sustainable urban transportation policy. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of complex systems and different kinds of concerns to be taken into proper account. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - PurposeThe global construction industry has a history of poor project success, with evident and frequent overruns in cost and schedule. This industry is a highly interconnected and complex system in which the components, i.e. suppliers, contractors, end-users, and stakeholders, are delicately linked to each other, the community, and the environment. Therefore, defining and measuring project success can be challenging for sponsors, contractors, and the public. To address this issue, this study develops and analyzes a more comprehensive set of success criteria for medium and large construction projects.Design/methodology/approachAfter reviewing the existing literature, this study identified 19 success criteria for medium and large construction projects, which were categorized into five groups. The fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (fuzzy DEMATEL) method was used to gain further insight into the interrelationships between these categories and explain the cause-and-effect relationships among them. Next, this study applied the modified logarithmic least squares method to determine the importance weight of these criteria using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process.Findings28 project managers working in the construction industries in Australia and New Zealand participated in this study. Results suggest that "project efficiency" and "impacts on the project team" are cause criteria that affect "business success," "impacts on stakeholders," and "impacts on end-users." Effective risk management emerged as the most crucial criterion in project efficiency, while customer satisfaction and return on investment are top criteria in "impacts on end-users" and "business success."Originality/valueAlthough numerous studies have been conducted on project success criteria, multicriteria analyses of success criteria are rare. This paper presents a comprehensive set of success criteria tailored to medium and large construction projects. The aim is to analyze their interrelationships and prioritize them thoroughly, which will aid practitioners in focusing on the most important criteria for achieving higher success rates.

AB  - The ability of private conservation organizations to remain financially viable is a key factor influencing their effectiveness. One-third of financially motivated private-land conservation areas (PLCAs) surveyed in South Africa are unprofitable, raising questions about landowners' abilities to effectively adapt their business models to the socioeconomic environment. In any complex system, options for later adaptation can be constrained by starting conditions (path dependence). We tested 3 hypothesized drivers of path dependence in PLCA ecotourism and hunting business models: (H1) the initial size of a PLCA limits the number of mammalian game and thereby predators that can be sustained; (H2) initial investments in infrastructure limit the ability to introduce predators; and (H3) rainfall limits game and predator abundance. We further assessed how managing for financial stability (optimized game stocking) or ecological sustainability (allowing game to fluctuate with environmental conditions) influenced the ability to overcome path dependence. A mechanistic PLCA model based on simple ecological and financial rules was run for different initial conditions and management strategies, simulating landowner options for adapting their business model annually. Despite attempts by simulated landowners to increase profits, adopted business models after 13 years were differentiated by initial land and infrastructural assets, supporting H1 and H2. A conservation organization's initial assets can cause it to become locked into a financially vulnerable business model. In our 50-year simulation, path dependence was overcome by fewer of the landowners who facilitated natural ecological variability than those who maintained constant hunting rates and predator numbers, but the latter experienced unsustainably high game densities in low rainfall years. Management for natural variability supported long-term ecological sustainability but not shorter term socioeconomic sustainability for PLCAs. Our findings highlight trade-offs between ecological and economic sustainability and suggest a role for governmental support of the private conservation industry.

AB  - Over recent years, the sustainability and resilience concept has increased its significance in the construction industry. Sustainability is associated with implementing best practices in the construction industry, while resilience is the adaptability and tolerance of systems in harsh conditions. The concepts are learned in the construction process. Moreover, building automation is growing rapidly, and buildings are becoming increasingly dependent on complex systems and technology and susceptible to unanticipated failure. Though sustainability and resilience concepts are interlinked, limited research quantifies their combination, resulting in a limited comprehension of how both concepts interact during application by developers in a smart building. Therefore, this study has established a financial model that employs Net Present Value (NPV) in studying the inference and clampdown of investment in both concepts. NPV was estimated using indirect and direct costs and benefits derived from the continuous integration of sustainability and resilience in a smart building. To quantify sustainability, its three components had to be quantified. Reduced energy expenditure and government environmental incentives were used to calculate the environmental component. Workers' cost savings, fire insurance cost savings, and additional system maintenance costs were used to calculate the economic component. The social component of sustainability measured hard-to-quantify attributes like productivity, indoor environment quality, reputation, extra profit, services, and safety. To quantify them, a survey and RII method were used. The two concepts were then coupled by estimating the benefits and costs of installing and keeping resilience tools in design that are sustainable in the smart building and the impact study on the NPV outcome. Application of the design model was also carried out on four smart buildings that were selected in Dubai. The result indicated that coupling sustainable approaches and resilience yields higher NPV by at least 22%. Nevertheless, for NPV to be maintained positively and reduce the cost of failure, faulty detection tools should be assimilated while designing sustainable and smart buildings. The findings of this study will contribute to the benefit of other researchers, developers, investors, managers, engineers, and anyone who is involved in the design or construction process of intelligent buildings.

AB  - This paper explores how climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy pose new systemic financial risks (so-called Green Swans), and the role of central banks in addressing them within their financial stability mandate. It does so by developing a three-layered analytical framework that central banks could use to shape their climate-related monetary and financial policies. First, central banks have already started to revisit their backward-looking risk models for the purpose of integrating forward-looking climate-related risks. Second, given the limitations of existing climate-economy models in a context of radical uncertainty, we argue that future climate scenario analysis should rely on systems-based approaches such as non-equilibrium models and more qualitative tools such as those provided by a socio-technical perspective. However, even these new approaches will not suffice from the perspective of financial stability: climate-related risks will remain largely unhedgeable as long as a system-wide and structural transformation is not undertaken, including an unprecedented level of cooperation between central banks, fiscal authorities, the private and public sectors at large, civil society, and the international community. Third, and as a result of the first two points, embracing climate-related uncertainty means that central banks play a new role: helping to coordinate the policies needed to fight climate change, so as to fulfil their own mandate of financial stability. To this end, we make a few specific policy proposals.
   Key policy insights
   Central banks' traditional risk models do not enable them to identify climate-related systemic risks (Green Swans).
   Adopting new forward-looking and non-equilibrium modelling approaches is necessary to better appreciate the nature of climate-related risks, but it is not sufficient.
   To continue fulfilling their mandate of financial stability over longer time horizons than those traditionally considered, central banks must also get involved in policy coordination to mitigate climate change.
   This includes exploring which policy mixes (fiscal-monetary-prudential) can better address the climate imperatives ahead; considering climate stability as a global public good to be supported through reforms of the international monetary and financial system; and systematizing the integration of long-term sustainability criteria in both private and public sectors.

AB  - It is commonly recognized that there are constraints to successful regional-scale assessment and monitoring of cumulative impacts because of challenges in the selection of coherent and measurable indicators of the effects. It has also been sensibly declared that the connections between components in a region are as important as the state of the elements themselves. These have previously been termed "linked" cumulative impacts/effects. These connections can be difficult to discern because of a complicated set of interactions and unexpected linkages. In this paper we diagnose that a significant cause of these constraints is the selection of indicators without due regard for their inter-relationships in the formulation of the indicator set. The paper examines whether the common "forms of capital", i.e., natural (renewable and non-renewable), manufactured, social, human and financial capitals, framework is a potential organizing structure. We examine a large region in western NSW Australia where the predominant production systems are mining and grazing for production of wool, beef and lamb. Production in both is driven by consumption of a non-renewable resource, i.e., ore for mining and topsoil for grazing, the latter on the basis that loss rate estimates far exceed soil formation rates. We propose that the challenge of identifying connections of components within and between capital stores can be approached by explicitly separating stores of capital and the flows of capital between stores and between elements within stores, so-called capital fluxes. We attempt to acquire data from public sources for both capital stores and fluxes. The question of whether these data are a sufficient base for regional assessment, with particular reference to connections, is discussed. The well-described challenge of a comparative common currency for stores and fluxes is also discussed. We conclude that the data acquisition is relatively successful for stores and fluxes. A number of linked impacts are identified and discussed. The potential use of money as the common currency for stores and fluxes of capital is considered. The basic proposition is that replacement or preservation costs be used for this. We conclude that the study is sufficiently positive to consider further research in fully-coupled models of capital stores and fluxes. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A brief review of banana research and development efforts over the past 20 years suggests that the major pre-occupations of banana researchers - leaf spots, Fusarium wilt, bacterial wilts, bunchy top, nematodes, weevils - have not greatly changed and that we have not 'solved' any of the major problems of growers. New pathogen problems, such as Xanthomonas wilt, have cropped up, and others in which research effort has been invested, such as the streak virus complex, remain intractable. Meanwhile, many of the solutions proposed, such as high-yielding, disease-resistant hybrids, genetically transformed versions of existing cultivars and forecasting systems to reduce spray applications, also look discouragingly familiar. And even where they have been delivered as promised by researchers, they have not been widely adopted by producers. On the other hand, papers submitted to this symposium do suggest a move away from such 'single-technology' solutions towards more integrated, knowledge-based approaches, which recognise the complexity of both the biophysical and the socio-economic dimensions of crop production problems. This trend is evident across the whole spectrum of research, from genetic modification projects that start by trying to understand the finer details of plant-pathogen interactions, to organic banana projects that seek to understand the underlying processes of crop and agro-ecosystem health, indicating some convergence between what would previously have been considered 'high-tech' and 'low-tech' approaches. It is also encouraging to see a greater emphasis on the social and policy environment that can enable or inhibit the adoption of new technologies, as well as the process of producer-level innovation as a whole. Unfortunately, the multidisciplinary study of complex systems is not cheap, and several years of consistent investment may be required to yield results. Similarly, the adoption of relatively complex, knowledge-based technologies implies a serious investment in capacity building at various levels. The onus is now on advocates of such approaches to demonstrate that the required investment is truly cost effective in terms of greater impacts and sustainability. In conclusion, it is argued that better targeting of research efforts and concerted international action provide the key to ensuring that the substantial investments required by integrated, knowledge-based approaches are indeed cost effective in practice.

AB  - Historically, soils have always underpinned civilisation. Their role is fundamental to the provision of food and water, along with a wide range of ecosystem goods and services. Soils are arguably the most complex systems oil Earth, and are intimately linked to human security and the integrity of the wider environment. In this paper we propose 18 ecosystem services that are critical for soils and land use in the UK. Soils are extremely heterogeneous and not all soils can fulfil the full spectrum of services required for the future of the UK, so there is a need to protect their Multifunctional attributes in order to preserve national and international natural capital. There are concerns that anthropogenically induced changes in land use or management will result ill Soils not being utilised to provide the functions to which they are best suited. For example, soils primarily suited for food Supply may be given over to Provide a platform for construction. This is ail all-pervading and recurring concern and highlights the importance of critical decisions, thresholds and potential 'tipping points'. Once critical soil functions are lost they are irrecoverable, potentially for millennia, representing a loss of resource that is fundamental to the UK's national livelihood and well-being. Pressures from changes in climate and to the Earth system will bring about complex and systematic change to soils and their abilities to provide essential functions. We therefore recommend national needs for ensuring the sustainability for soils and future land use in the UK. They are to maintain the long-term base for soil science through education and intellectual investment. including communication of the value of soils and land as natural capital; to manage soil resources so that multifunctionality prevails and critical tipping points are avoided; to audit the national soil resource through soil mapping; preparation of appropriate databases and provision of long-term monitoring networks and observatories; and to synthesise adaptable predictive frameworks for soil system science through integrated modelling.

AB  - We present an economics framework appropriate to the exceptionally broad scope of the climate change problem. This considers that economic and social processes, particularly those involved in purposive transitions of energy technologies and systems, involve the interplay between three distinct domains of decision-making and associated actors. The first concerns small-scale and often short-term decision-making, much of which reflects extensive 'satisficing' and habituation as identified in behavioural economics. Calculated economic optimization decisions, especially of companies in the energy and energy-intensive industries, then best reflect the core assumptions of neoclassical and welfare economics, including discrete market failures. Third, at the largest scale are strategic judgements made by big actors (e.g. governments, large multinational companies) relevant to transformation of complex systems over long periods-particularly concerning innovation and structural changes, for which lessons from theories of evolutionary and institutional economics are most relevant.Economically, these can be logically mapped in relation to the technology (or more accurately, 'best practice') frontier. Each has corresponding policy implications: most directly, respectively in terms of (i) standards and engagement to establish norms; (ii) competitive markets with the critical role of prices; and (iii) strategic investment in innovation and infrastructure. Each faces challenges of implementation and government failure, as observed, for example, with wholly inadequate carbon pricing to date, naive and ineffective approaches to enhancing energy efficiency, or misdirected support to R&D. Based on the domain distinctions, we argue that the corresponding pillars of policy are naturally complementary, and can be mutually supportive: strong standards and norms on energy efficiency, for example, would enhance the political space for carbon pricing by reducing its direct consumer impacts, while carbon pricing has multiple positive two-way interactions with enhanced low-carbon innovation.From this we also posit a 'carbon pricing paradox': that adequate carbon prices, the central recommendation of most economists, are in most jurisdictions only feasible (or even optimal) if equal analytic and policy attention is devoted to the other pillars, and the wider context of macroeconomic and fiscal policies. Only these other aspects can reduce the absolute cost impact of carbon pricing (potentially turning into a gain) and offer consumers and businesses better lower-carbon alternatives, which are critical to establishing climate-compatible pricing structures across our economies.

AB  - Taiwan's encouragement of installing solar photovoltaic power plants (SPPPs) on warehouse rooftops is a step towards sustainability and profitable investment. This study, analyzing the installations of STY Company, found that rooftop SPPPs significantly boost revenue, with rates increasing from 2.0088% to 6.8681% over 20 years. The break-even point is in the 7th year, with a return rate ranging from 2.0088 to 2.1748%. This shows that SPPP investments are a benefit for investors, shortening construction times and allowing warehouses to sell solar energy at an earlier date. This research utilized a fuzzy nonlinear multi-objective programming model to examine trade-offs between construction time, cost, quality, and revenue (TCQR) to optimize SPPP construction. The findings suggest that reducing construction time is an effective strategy to lower carbon emissions despite potential cost increases. However, time and quality costs are inversely proportional, highlighting the importance of efficient project management in minimizing the impacts of this trade-off. Adjusting funding can maintain quality while speeding up construction. Completing projects early also heightens revenue from green energy sales, offsetting higher initial investments. The TCQR focuses on investment revenue, managing time efficiently, and making data-driven decisions to expedite SPPP development. This model improves project profitability and promotes sustainable growth by reducing construction time and optimizing financial strategies. This study's contribution includes: 1. Optimizing the installation process of warehouse rooftop SPPPs, which provide significant long-term revenue and environmental benefits. 2. Combining the different research methods of scholars into fuzzy methods that can solve complex systems with high uncertainty. The nonlinear model put forth by this study is closer to the actual situation and can handle balancing complex problems in multi-objective programming. 3. Improving the efficiency of time management to make it feasible to reduce construction time to lower carbon emissions. 4. Concocting a comprehensive approach integrating financial, environmental, and operational factors for successful SPPP development. This study addresses an academic gap. Previously, scholars conducted research independently, focusing solely on financial investment or time, cost, and quality (TCQ) issues without considering the two together. By combining financial investment with TCQ, this study fills a significant gap in academic research. According to this study, better investment returns could improve the promotion of solar energy. Unlike previous research, this study integrates the analysis of TCQ with that of revenue by assessing costs and revenues together. This approach allows decision-makers to derive judgments from the TCQR model quickly.

AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to draw attention to an urgent need for reform of the regulatory framework of the broader export credit system to ensure a new and comprehensive "safe haven" for officially supported export credits. The purpose is to analyse the complex debate on disciplines of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), creating a point of reference for future analysis of and debates around the "carve-out clause" of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) and a "safe haven" in a broader sense. Design/methodology/approachThis paper takes inspiration from legal, economic and political science literature on subsidies and officially supported export credits, as well as on legal documents related to the WTO and the OECD. It examines the WTO subsidy and the OECD export credits framework, focusing on main legal and economic governance aspects. Then, it gives a critical analysis how "safe" a "safe haven" in a broader sense might be, assessing frictions of and solutions for the fundamentally different set of disciplines, limitations, financial instruments not covered by OECD regulations, as well as new challenges related to climate finance. FindingsAfter assessing the challenges regarding the "carve-out clause" of the WTO subsidy framework and two tracks aiming to create a new "safe haven", requirements for comprehensive disciplines for officially supported export credits are pointed out. Furthermore, several misunderstandings and mistakes appearing in the debate are clarified. Research limitations/implicationsDesktop research rather than empirical field work. Practical implicationsThis paper creates awareness for governments and exporters how to deal with a complex system of interrelated disciplines. The question, how "safe" a "safe haven" in a broader sense can be, has not been resolved yet. Some authors focus on the WTO disciplines not taking into account the need for an effective matching procedure of the Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (the Arrangement). Furthermore, the introduction of several new pre-export financing programmes and the growing significance of climate finance-related instruments for export credit agencies creates both opportunities and challenges. This paper can serve as a reference point for the academic debate and further research. This paper also offers newcomers to the topic a comprehensive overview. Originality/valueAlthough the "carve-out clause" and the Arrangement have been much discussed, there is limited literature review structuring both existing and new aspects of the debate, assessing (dis)advantages of arguments and interpretations. This paper both adds to the corpus of literature about the ASCM, as well as the Arrangement, and takes this corpus as the object of its analysis.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming more and more the key challenge for organisations. Sustainability depends on internal and external characteristics of the organisation that should or must be preserved within the time and depends on the definition of what is a suitable state of the system (organisation and its environment) within medium and long terms as safety can be seen as feature of sustainability. The concept of sustainability is a key concept for safety researchers and practitioners. The reverse is true as safety concepts are useful to think sustainability which is still rather new. They share common research grounds on management and organisations sciences.
   In France, as exemplary organisations, public organisations are working on issues related to both the assessment and governance of sustainability. In this paper we propose a "proactive-based assessment" designed to measure an organisation's ability to govern and achieve sustainability.
   The proposed assessment method relies on three new concepts: "critical capital"; Highly Sustainable Organisation (HSO), and learning stages within an HSO.
   Although there are some elements of unpredictability in complex systems, sustainability for an organisation is based at least on its ability to learn and adapt. There are different ways of conceiving sustainability for public organisations. Even though there is no consensus on the way public organisations are conceived, there is still a philosophical and political agreement on the need for more sustainability. However, it is still unclear and sometimes not even pointed "what should be sustained for public organisations?". We suggest that the "critical capital" is characterised by internal and external aspects of the organisation that should be preserved within the time such as (i) the way of functioning of the organisation, (ii) the way the missions are performed or exercised by the organisation to meet what is contextually referred as being of public and common needs and (iii) the "organisational memory" that represents the identity of the public organisation and the assets of the public organisation. The term "Capital" does not refer to its definition in economy but to its given definitions in sociology (see for example Ferragina, 2010) and ecology (see for example Jansson, 1994). Criticality is fixed "according to the way public service is conceived, to the contextual constraints (such as economical, environmental, social, cultural and ethical) and according to the degree and the nature of threats (natural and manmade hazards).
   We suggest that organisational sustainability is the ability of the system to preserve and to maintain, within the time, a critical capital and to adapt to its ecosystem. Accordingly, a loss of organisational sustainability indicate whether the organisation is prone to shift to an undesirable organisational state that would decrease the ability or even cease to provide services to the ecosystem and to maintain its identity. In other words, it is an organisation that loses part of its critical capital.
   Accordingly, we have proposed a development stage model to make explicit the way we have observed in these organisations a common progression in the initiatives they have taken to address sustainability challenges and build learning and innovation capabilities.
   The three concepts arise from a four years investigation and observation of more than 60 public organisations in France and the coordination, at a national level, of the French working group on "governance of public organisations" that end up with the publication of four national guidelines in March 2013.

AB  - Waste management in low-income countries faces challenges with an average cost of $35/ton approximately 51% collection efficiency. Despite investments in treatment, processing, and recycling, the system remains unsustainable owing to poor planning and policies. The current analysis of Lahore's solid waste management (SWM) system, selected as a major city of a low-income country as a case study, focuses on collection efficiency and waste generation. However, it neglects the complex and dynamic nature of SWM systems. To capture the complexities and dynamic nature of the SWM system, system dynamic (SD) modeling is proposed for its effectiveness in modeling complex and dynamic systems. Unlike previous attempts at SD modeling that mostly consider only some components of the SWM system with varying success, this study attempts to use a holistic approach by considering all aspects of an integrated SWM system. In addition, this study explores different financial and management policies, highlighting the weaknesses of the system through a quantitative comparison of three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU) which considers the current trends in waste generation and practices of collection and disposal to landfill, (2) waste treatment system (WTS) in which various waste treatment systems are included to reduce burden on landfill, and (3) introduction of user fee with awareness campaigns (UFAC) which encourages community participation towards reduction in waste generation and financially supports the SWM. All three scenarios use four indices: waste generation, waste ending up in landfill, uncollected waste, and annual budget deficit as performance indices. These scenarios were simulated over a 25-year period using an SD model, covering all six components of the SWM system. The BAU scenario shows a 16% increase in waste generation, a 173% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 64% increase in the budget deficit over the simulation period, indicating an unsustainable SWM system. The WTS scenario exhibits a 16% increase in waste generation, a 155% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 61% increase in the budget deficit, showing a significant reduction in landfill waste and a slight reduction in deficit but it remains unsustainable. The UFAC scenario, however, results in a 40% reduction in waste generation, a 67% decrease in uncollected waste, an 8% decrease in landfill waste, and a 59% decrease in the budget deficit. These results demonstrate that instituting user fees for SWM services and incentivizing community participation towards waste reduction and segregation can make the SWM system of Lahore sustainable. This SD model provides insights for policymakers, aiding what-if analyses and long/short-term waste management plans for metropolitan cities in low-income countries. To validate the sustainability judgments based on performance indices, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool commonly used for ranking policy decisions based on competing criteria, was employed. It considered the same four criteria as in the SD model. The results of the AHP analysis aligned with those of the SD model, ranking the UFAC scenario as the most sustainable option.

AB  - Financial stability is an important measure used by stakeholders to assess the financial situation of an entity concerned. Economic worries caused by internal business issues, global processes, and international economic (regional) integration may increase the entity's exposure to external factors. Financial stability considers the entity's dependence on creditors and investors, i.e. the debt-to-equity ratio. Significant liabilities that are not fully covered by the entity's own liquid funds create preconditions for bankruptcy should any large creditor demand settlement of any debts owed to it. However, borrowed funds can significantly increase the return on equity. Therefore, in analyzing financial stability, it is very important to use a system of indicators that indicate the entity's future risks and profitability.
   Financial stability is the principal objective of financial analysis. The nature and scope of such economic analysis are aimed to determine the entity's internal capacities, means, and methods for improving the entity's financial stability. Thus, financial stability is understood as the entity's guaranteed solvency and creditworthiness resulting from the effective formation, distribution, and application of financial resources in the entity's business operations. Financial stability is assessed based on the working capital to inventory ratio and debt to equity ratio.
   Business entities are independent in establishing business relationships with their contract partners; therefore, they are fully responsible for the decisions they make. The increasing importance of financial analysis for the entity's own financial situation and for its business partners is explained by the increasing demand for additional sources of business financing and the requirement to increase the productiveness of capital resources.
   Entity's financial stability analysis should not focus on the current financial activities only. It should also determine what measures should be taken on a continuous basis to maintain and improve the entity's financial situation. Both current and future stability, i.e. the entity's sustainability, must be ensured to provide conditions for state-of-the-art competitive production.
   An entity is a complex system consisting of many subsystems; therefore, a complex method must be applied to analyze its stability, i.e. using a system of financial stability indicators. Present-day diversity of financial stability indicators, including both absolute and relative indicators, makes the analysis difficult and overcomplicated, creating difficulties in combining the findings of the analysis to make conclusions about the entity's financial stability. Absolute indicators, namely equity, borrowed capital, assets, cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, profit, play an important role in the analysis of an entity's financial stability. Equally important are absolute indicators calculated in the analysis of financial statements: net assets, working capital, working capital to inventory ratio, stable liabilities. These indicators are criterial as they are used to establish the criteria used in the financial analysis.
   An entity should have a flexible structure of financial resources and, if necessary, be able to borrow funds. Therefore, another manifestation of an entity's potential financial stability is its creditworthiness, i.e., the ability to settle its payment obligations when due. Thus, an entity is considered creditworthy if it meets a certain requirement for granting a loan and is able to repay the loan when due subject to any interest accrued. This concept is closely related to the concept of financial stability and shows whether the company is able to raise funds from different sources to repay its debts. Credit analysis may predict solvency and is closely related to the analysis of solvency, financial stability and return on equity. Entity's stable operation, high profitability and working capital turnover also guarantee loan repayment to a certain degree.

AB  - Based on sustainable development theory and the method of system dynamics and multi-agent simulation, the environment-economy-society relationship model of Liaohe River Basin is constructed by coupling the system dynamics model with the multi-agent model in the software-NetLogo. This paper selects the Qinghe, Fanhe and Puhe River of Liaohe River Basin which are located in Shenyang and Tieling City as the study boundary, then the overall situation of environment, economy and society development is analyzed. At the same time, in order to simulate and predict the overall operation of the model under different policies, three kinds of development scenarios are established by changing some key variables including pollution abatement investment, fixed assets investment and industrial waste water production of ten thousand yuan industrial output value. The results show that the development under different policies can be simulated and predicted by this model, which will provide support for macroeconomic regulation and control the sustainable development strategy of Liaohe River Basin.

AB  - The probability that an energy system will successfully enter into operation and perform the required function of the criteria within the allowed tolerances for a given period of time and given environmental conditions (working temperature, pressure, humidity, permissible vibrations, noise and shock, changes in operating parameters of labor, etc.) represents its effectiveness. The effectiveness indicator is characterized by a unit (unit parameter) or several effectiveness properties (complex parameter), such as: reliability (the ability of system to maintain continuous working ability within the limits of allowed deviations during the calendar period of time, quantified through indicators: probability of operation without cancellation, medium time in work, intensity of cancellation and cancellation rate), maintenance convenience (ability to prevent and detect cancellation and damage, to restore working ability and correctness through technical service and technical repairs, quantified through: probability of renewal for the given calendar period of time, medium recovery time and the intensity of renewal), durability (the system's ability to maintain its working ability from the very beginning of its application or exploitation until the transition to limit states in which certain stop is possible in the realization of certain activities for technical service maintenance and repairs, defined through indicators: medium resource, gamma-percentage resource, medium expiration date, gamma-percentage life), stability (the system's ability to continuously maintain hot reserves, storage and/or transport). Optimal management of complex technical systems must be based on the assessment and complex optimization of the reliability indicators, depending on how they are provided and the hierarchical level of detailing, as well as the current phase of the life cycle. For these reasons, the optimization process includes the basic structural, parametric and constructive solutions related to the technical system itself through the change of its most important characteristics: efficiency (mostly energy), maneuverability, reliability and economic effectiveness in general. The set of goals of optimization is concluded in the overall choice of reliability indicators and possible ways to secure them, and given the already established rules regarding the higher hierarchical level of the system. Creating effectiveness is closely related to the concrete energy system, its behavior at a certain time and the environment in which it works (the power system as a higher hierarchical system). For this realization, it is necessary to provide the appropriate backgrounds, first of all the database, then to define based on the function of the goal and the available database of the interconnection and the relationship between the individual elements of the system. Within this chapter, appropriate methods will be provided for prognosis and optimizing the effectiveness based on the quality of design, production and testing, assembly and trial release, exploitation, development of procedures for prognosis of the complex systems behavior based on the characteristics of certain constituent elements of the system and the possible impact of human factors and environment itself on the system.
   Starting from the initial stage of development, design and conquering the production of certain types of thermal energy equipment in the goal of fulfilling all requirements without limitations, if it is based on its purpose, a multivariate assembly is set up before the designer, with the need to optimize according to certain already adopted algorithms. The goal is to create such a facility that has a satisfactory structure in terms of reliability indicators, with minimal costs of maintenance during the projected working life. Defining the plant that best meets the set requirements related to reliability and the process of exploitation and maintenance itself must be the result of the implemented optimization process (in this case, on the basis of the selected minimum investment criterion). The sum consumption of all devices that ensure the normal operation of the thermal power plant is called own consumption. General consumption consists of all other devices that do not have a direct impact on the technological process at the plant. Preserving the continuity in supplying of own power consumption is essential for safe operation under normal operating conditions, in the case of short-term transitions, as well as in starting and normal stopping, it is particularly important in case of stopping in case of disorder or failure of the system. With the growing unit block strength, there is also the growth of unit power of electric motors with their own consumption, and therefore requirements related to the power supply. The basic problem is to achieve safe power supply in a variety of drive operation situations, with fewer short-circuit currents and the voltage drop when starting large synchronous motors. The solution is achieved by the proper choice of the transformer of own consumption and voltage level.

AB  - The human consumption behavior is the main parameter for the environmental pollution. Especially now in today's globalized world, using fast moving consumer goods has become more widespread, eventually resulting in a significant increase in the waste generation. This increase is ominously caused by the packaging wastes especially with its implicit economic value.
   The materials used in packaging industry are plastics, metal, glass, paper, wood and composites. The food and beverage packaging, which commonly uses plastic, metal, glass and composite materials has a market share amounting to approximately 70% in the overall packaging sector [1]. In 2018, 1,167.5 billion liters of packaged beverages were consumed worldwide [2].
   With the above in mind, the packaging waste also has a detrimental impact to the pollution of the ecosystem unless they are not managed properly. Many countries try to solve this problem by collecting beverage packaging before they get mixed with other wastes and send the beverage packaging to recycling facilities. In Europe, 74% of glass, 80% of metal and 42% of plastic was recycled in 2016 and 2017 [1] [3]. However, these percentages are not enough to prevent pollution and ensure sustainability. According to Lebreton et al., each year 1.15 to 2.41 million tons of plastic waste streams from rivers to oceans [4].
   There are several experimented options to solve this problem without causing a loss in the value of the relevant packaging material. In order to reproduce a packaging material, in the exact same form and quality with the materials produced from the raw material, the quality and status of the used material becomes rather important. Therefore, a specific method, among others, becomes prominent for the recollection of the used beverage packaging, before these become wasted and contaminated. This system is called "Deposit Refund System (DRS)". In the DRS, each beverage packaging shall have a certain deposit value and with each purchase the consumer shall pay that deposit value in addition to the product price.
   After the consumption of the beverage, the consumer returns the empty packaging and the deposit value is refunded to the consumer. This system leads the way to clean and effective collection of recyclable beverage packaging. Around the world, 45 countries are currently using the DRS and in average 88% of their beverage packaging are recycled via this system [5].
   The DRS is a very complex system that concerns too many stakeholders. The success of the system depends on a clear structuring and outlining of the relationships, duties, authorities and responsibilities of each partaker. Accordingly, the legal framework shall set forth a comprehensive framework, in order to regulate all procedures and principles relating to the DRS.
   The main outcome of the study will be to determine the advantages of implementing the DRS in Turkey, for beverage packaging waste management. In addition, we will also analyze the governance models of DRS, where the DRS is run by an Operator. In most of the countries, this operator is generally a non-profit organization, established by beverage producers and retailers. In this study, we will also examine the alternative governance models, such as state owned and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. We have also focused on the PPP model, as an innovative and efficient tool and a suitable model for the performance of DRS system. We will further elaborate on the financial sustainability of the PPP projects and how to create "bankable projects". As an innovative model for the DRS, we created a well-structured finance model with resilience revenue stream in the PPP option for long-term public services. Accordingly, these should be taken into consideration during the establishment and the implementation of the DRS design.
   The DRS comprises of several operational steps, which are the collection of empty containers from consumers through reverse vending machines (RVMs) or manual return points, the transfer to scoring and bailing facilities. The DRS Operator shall be responsible for these operational processes. The countries who apply the DRS are relatively smaller than Turkey, by surface area and population. This difference creates a need for designing a DRS, based specifically on Turkey's needs and properties. For this purpose, relevant studies, sectoral and governmental reports about the DRS and Turkish packaging waste management system was researched and suggestions based on technical structure, governance model and legal background will be given as an output of the study. On the other hand, a very well-designed database operating software is necessary to measure all processes in the system and to combat counterfeiting and fraud.
   Another impressive impact of the DRS is that it is the proper and easiest way to adopt circular economy concept for communities, industries, and governments. Since one of the main purposes of circular economy is usage of waste material (such as packaging waste) as a raw material in different production fields, the implementation of the DRS would achieve this aim by definition. Segregated collection of wastes becomes a very important issue for the reproduction of new products from recycled materials. Such collection method is also significantly important for resource preservation, which is another crucial matter in circular economy. For an effective production process, the packaging waste is required to be clean and without any contamination. The DRS is one of the best implementation mechanisms for separate collection of packaging waste. European Commission has been working on circular economy and they submitted the New Circular Economy Action Plan in March 2020 [6]. This new plan aims to design entire life cycle of products while promoting circular economy processes, fostering sustainable consumption and aiming to keep resources available as much as possible in EU's economy.
   Lastly, we will also be considering and examining other environmental benefits of the DRS in Turkey.

AB  - PurposeQuite often than not, a new industry can be created, thanks to the countless entrepreneurs and innovative activities across the globe. Smart city (SC) is one such industry and a living lab using the key roles of the digital platform that enable a seamless flow of information and knowledge for innovation within the SC. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how SC can be a new regional industry engine through an "open collective innovation system" as its new concept. In particular, SC provides efficient transaction costs and knowledge flows. Eventually, SC can be an innovation hub for entrepreneurship through openness.Design/methodology/approachTo frame the research goals, the authors used qualitative research methodologies based on grounded theory. In particular, the author used inductive reasoning to generate arguments and conclusions about the future of an SC as a new growth engine in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. Numerous documents and prior literature were used for the preliminary conceptualization of an SC. Interview data were then coded for reasoning in an open collective innovation system based on "openness".FindingsSC maximizes efficiency in practicing innovation. In the perspective of innovation costs, SC can minimize transaction costs, specifically the information processing costs, through data openness. In this context, transaction costs can be considered an economic equivalent of friction in a physical system. So, as the friction is low, some movements of an object on the surface are likely to be easy. SC is optimized for innovation activities through an "open collective innovation system". In terms of innovation networks, an SC results in an innovation efficiency derived from both the network and the spatial agglomerations in physical and cyberspace. The efficiency-based SC itself overlaps knowledge creation, dissemination and absorption, providing an open innovation (OI) ecosystem.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper remarkably extends that SC can be an "open collective innovation system model" and a new conceptualization. Eventually, SC will play a crucial role in developing regional industries as a new growth engine. To operate as a new growth engine fully-fledged, the SC is needed to accumulate innovative assets such as the critical mass of residents, numerous firms, etc. However, this study has some limitations. First, difficulties in any analytic approach to SC resulted from their many interdependent facets, such as social, economic, infrastructural and spatial complex systems, which exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Also, this research is at a quite an early stage. Thus, its theoretical stability is weak. So, this paper used the qualitative methodology with a grounded theory. Another limitation is in the research methodology. The limitation of using grounded theory adapted by this work is that the results of this study may not be generalizable beyond the context of this study. This non-generalizability occurs because ours is an inductive approach to research, meaning that the findings are based on data collected and analyzed. As such, the results of this study may not be applicable to other contexts or situations. In addition, the analysis of data in the grounded theory is based on researcher's subjective interpretations. This means that the researcher's own biases, preferences and assumptions may influence the results of the study. The quality of the data collected is another potential limitation.
   If the data is incomplete or of poor quality, it can cause researcher's own subjective interpretations.Practical implicationsFindings of this study have some practical implications for enterprises, practitioners and governors. First, firms should use value networks instead of value chains. Notably, the firms that pursue new products or services or startups that try to find a new venture business should take full advantage of SC. This taking advantage is possible because SC not only adapts state-of-the-art information technology (e.g. sensor devices, open data analytics, IoT and fiber optic networks) but also facilitates knowledge flow (e.g. between universities, research centers, knowledge-based partner firms and public agencies). More importantly, with globalized market competition in recent years, sustainability for firms is a challenging issue. In this respect, managers can take the benefits of SC into consideration for strategic decisions for sustainability. Specifically, industrial practitioners who engage in innovation activities have capabilities of network-related technologies (e.g. data analysis, AI, IoT and sensor networks). By using these technologies in an SC, enterprises can keep existing customers as well as attract potential customers. Lastly, the findings of this study contribute to policy implementation in many aspects. At first, for SC to become a growth engine at regional or natural levels, strong policy implementation is crucial because SC is widely regarded as a means of entrepreneurship and an innovation plaza (Kraus et al., 2015). To facilitate entrepreneurship, maker spaces used for making the prototypes to support entrepreneurial process were setup within universities. The reason for establishing maker spaces in universities is to expand networking between entrepreneurs and experts and lead to innovation through a value network. One of the policy instruments that can be adapted is the "Data Basic Income Scheme" suggested by this research to boost the usage of data, providing content and information for doing business. Also, a governor in SC as an intermediator for the process of the knowledge flow should initiate soft configuration for SC.Social implicationsThis work makes two theoretical contributions to OI aspects: (1) it explores dynamic model archetypes; and (2) it articulates and highlights how SC with digital technology (i.e. in the AI, IoT and big data context) can be used to create collective knowledge flow efficiently. First, the findings of this study shed light on the OI dynamic model. It reveals important archetypes of new sub-clustering creation, namely, a system that underpins the holistic process of innovation by categorization in amongst the participating value network (Aguilar-Gallegos et al., 2015). In innovation studies, scholars have particularly paid attention to a cluster's evolution model. In the process of innovation, the "open innovation dynamic model" suggested by this study illustrates sub-clustering that happens in value networks by taking the benefits of SC. Eventually, the evolution or development of sub-clusters can bring in a new system, namely, an OI system. Second, the findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the role of digital technologies in promoting knowledge flow. The usage and deployment of digital technologies in SC may enormously and positively influence innovative activities for participants. Furthermore, the rising of digital economy, in the so-called platform business, may occur depending on advanced technologies and OI.
   In doing so, the findings can further tow innovation research through juxtaposition between SC and innovation research (Mehra et al., 2021).Originality/valueThis paper shows that the function of an SC not only improves the quality of life but also acts as an engine of new industry through an open collective innovation setting using dynamic and ecological models.

AB  - Methanol is a key product in the chemical industry, not only for producing other higher economic value chemicals, but also serves as a source of renewable energy that can substantially reduce carbon emissions. However, limited data are available on methanol total supply chain costs that consists of production, biomass cost, investment cost and the efficiency of the conversion processes. This paper recommends using an agent-based simulation-optimization in analyzing and reporting results by system elements (techno-economic assessment) or unit processes (life cycle assessment) as well as by the overall product system, of methanol supply chain. Major decision making are included in the agent-based simulation-optimization model to evaluate methanol synthesis pathways. This evaluation includes biomass and methanol ordering policy, capital budgeting during the lifetime of the methanol supply chain, carbon emissions per metric ton of methanol with specific focus on contribution to Indonesia Gross Domestic Product. The principal results obtained from the agent-based simulation show a better conversion technology pathway that leads to lower carbon emissions, higher internal rate of return, shorter payback period, and less price sensitivity of the methanol supply chain. The article proposes methanol from biogas as the chosen conversion technology pathway by considering its capability of sequestering carbon dioxide from bio-digester and lower capital investment, as well as its economic attrac-tiveness to methanol production investors.

AB  - Civil infrastructure systems transform over the long-term due to complex interactions among socio-environmental stressors, degradation of physical networks, and decision-making processes of infrastructure agencies. To incorporate such complex transformation mechanisms into infrastructure cost management, this study integrates simulation modeling and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to create a framework for dynamic network-level LCCA in infrastructure systems. The proposed framework was implemented using a multi-agent simulation model in a numerical case study related to a road network affected by sea-level rise, population growth, and uncertain maintenance funding. The results include identification of several state transition, and tipping point behaviors at which small changes in service demand, maintenance budget, and adaptation investment may result in significant improvement in network cost and performance conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework in modeling the long-term trajectories of life-cycle costs at the network level under different stressors and decision scenarios.

AB  - The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is seen as an important step towards environmental sustainability. Perhaps not surprising, many governments all around the world are providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). A positive response from consumers means that the demand for the charging infrastructure increases as well. We investigate how an existing traditional parking lot, upgraded with chargers, can suit the present demand for charging stations. In particular, a resulting EV-enabled parking lot is an electricity trading agent (i.e., broker) which acts as an energy retailer and as a player on a target electricity market. In this paper, we use agent-based simulation to present the EV-enabled parking lot ecosystem in order to model the underlying dynamics and uncertainties regarding parking lots with electricity trading agent functionalities. We instantiate our agent-based simulations using real-life data in order to perform the what-if analysis. Several key performance indicators (KPIs), including parking utilization, charging utilization and electricity utilization, are proposed. We also illustrate how those KPIs can be used to choose the effective investment strategy with respect to the number and speed of chargers.

AB  - Cities in many countries are witnessing an era of transformative innovations in vehicular technologies and mobility-on-demand (MoD) services in the context of global initiatives of smart and connected cities. However, advances in the built environment where vehicles operate have not maintained the same pace. The new MoD especially burdens curb environments in urban cores due to competition for spaces for pick-ups and drop-offs (PUDO). These uncoordinated and diverse uses without data-driven management have led to increased safety and sustainability issues. This research intends to address the increasing curbside uses of PUDO activities due to MoD services and proposes a data-driven agent-based simulation approach to plan designated PUDO zones in limited public curbside spaces. A case study was conducted for five street blocks in urban cores of the City of Gainesville, Florida, United States, based on longitudinal parking transaction and violation records, place visitation data, and geospatial data of parking assets. The results show that temporary PUDO zones should be designated at all investigated blocks during peak hours even when the MoD market penetration rate is low (i.e., 10%), which helps mitigate the occurrences of competing use events, while permanent PUDO zones should be designated for the two busiest blocks when the MoD market penetration rates increase to 30% or 50%. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the designated PUDO zones can mitigate curbside stresses more effectively when regulating MoD users' PUDO dwell time (e.g., within one minute). This research aims to contribute to data-driven public asset managerial decision-making and strategies in smart cities and benefits more accessible and sustainable living environments in urban cores.

AB  - Ageing populations, rapid technological progress and recent public budget cuts currently threaten the sustainability of public health systems. To meet growing needs with declining resources, decision-makers must identify new ways to avoid reducing the quality of services offered to citizens. This paper focuses on the so-called "co-payment'' tools aimed to obtain additional resources for the public health budget directly from citizens. Whereas certain forms of co-payments have always been introduced within health systems to prevent moral hazard behaviours, other co-payment mechanisms are explicitly intended to help finance public healthcare systems. Literature and empirical findings do not agree about the final impact of such co-payment tools, particularly whether they can attain system sustainability and guarantee equitably delivered services. In this paper, we develop an agent-based simulation model which can be used by decision-makers as a decision support tool to compare different co-payment rules and evaluate their impact on the public budget and the health expense of different groups of citizens.

AB  - Sustainability of infrastructure systems involves multiple interrelated objectives which are dependent on the dynamic behaviors of stakeholders, interdependencies between infrastructure assets, and evolving conditions in the social and environmental systems. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a framework that integrates: (1) different dimensions of sustainability in infrastructure networks, and (2) dynamic changes in the behaviors of stakeholders, asset performance conditions, and the social and environmental conditions. The proposed framework includes an agent based simulation model to capture the dynamic behaviors of decision makers and the evolving performance of infrastructure assets under different socio-environmental conditions. The outcomes of the simulation model include the short-and long-term costs and environmental impacts of infrastructure networks under different scenarios related to the changes in the socio-environmental conditions. The application of the framework is shown in a numerical case study of a road network. The results include: (i) identification of infrastructure management strategies (e.g., maintenance planning and funding allocation) that optimize the tradeoff between annual cost and environmental impacts of the network; and (ii) discovering robust management strategies that lead to highly-likely desired sustainability outcomes across different uncertain scenarios related to the future socio-environmental conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework for sustainability assessment of infrastructure systems based on integrated analysis of the dynamic behaviors of decision-makers, infrastructure characteristics, and evolving socio-environmental conditions. Hence, it provides a predictive quantitative tool to inform decision-making and policy formulation toward improving the sustainability of infrastructure networks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Recent requirements for sustainable development and increasing trend for public-private partnerships (PPPs) have added additional complexities to the policy-making process in the infrastructure management domain. To support policy analysis, this paper presents a system dynamics (SD) model to analyse the impact of different strategic policies (e.g. budgeting, PPP involvement) on infrastructure serviceability, backlog accumulation and sustainability. The proposed model has been implemented on a network of school buildings from the Toronto District School Board asset inventory. Four sets of experiments with different policy scenarios over a 50-year strategic planning horizon have been conducted to investigate policies related to rehabilitation, budget distribution, government investment and PPP involvement. The proposed model was implemented on a commercial SD software incorporating all the dynamic interactions among the strategic parameters. The experiment results show that the model works as a practical decision support tool that enables asset managers to test the effectiveness of various strategic policy scenarios on long-term infrastructure performance.

AB  - Urban last-mile delivery faces great challenges to satisfy growing customer demand with faster, punctual delivery expectations, under tight budgets and environmental requirements. The recently introduced physical internet (PI) offers a conceptual framework to address these challenges, overcoming low efficiency of current fragmented logistics operations with seamless asset sharing and flow consolidation leveraging hyperconnected systems. This article first provides a decision and system architecture for hyperconnected urban logistics, then investigates its potential at a strategic level through a simulation-based experiment in the context of large-item delivery. The results clearly demonstrate the potential of hyperconnected urban logsitics by concurrently improving often opposing measures: economic efficiency, service capability and sustainability.

AB  - Food processing industries confront challenges in dealing with wastewater due to seasonal fluctuations. This can lead to potentially untreated wastewater discharge and regulatory non-compliance. Untreated water can also adversely affect the efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment and the local environment. A mobile rental wastewater treatment service for the food processing industry has been proposed as an innovative solution, simultaneously promoting the Circular Economy through water reuse and material recovery. It enables on- demand and on-site wastewater processing, particularly during peak operation. Moreover, it provides additional services for extracting value-added compounds (e.g., polyphenols), delivering further financial benefits. To assess the sustainability of this new business model, this paper presents a hybrid simulation study using agent- based, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis. The hybrid model is applied to a new mobile wastewater service being trialled in the Peloponnesian region of Greece. By considering factors such as customer composition and the volume of wastewater to be treated, logistics (mobile units and hubs), and staggered investments in capacity boosting, the model supports the commercialisation efforts of the rental business model put forward in the case study. The paper contributes to modelling methodology, especially in the use of hybrid simulation within the context of the circular economy of water; it also contributes to the practice of modelling and simulation by exploring their role in assessing the feasibility of novel business models.

AB  - The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of financial key performance indicators (KPIs) namely customer accounts receivable flow time and credit limit allowed by financial partners-on the financial sustainability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) during business growth trajectories from an operations management perspective. This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs.

AB  - Microfinance has proliferated as both a poverty alleviation tool and catalyst for entrepreneurs running small-scale businesses with support from microloans. This article examines four rationales for incorporating concern for the natural environment into the practice of microfinance and suggests a typology to categorize microfinance sustainability initiatives as preserving, evolving, sustaining or restoring. Using a binomial descriptive content analysis of publicly available lending criteria, we investigate the incidence of 'green microfinance' in a sample of 40 Asian microfinance institutions (MFIs) - all members of the Banking with the Poor Network in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. We conclude that despite the existence of viable and strategic rationales to support the proliferation of 'green' microfinance, very few MFIs actually embed such a commitment into the structure of their financial products. This disconnect reveals that current microfinance practice in Asia, to the extent that it may ignore the natural environment, may correspondingly endanger the health and livelihoods of the very people it is designed to help. We consider this study as investigative and in need of replication in other regions; however, it reveals key contradictions while also suggesting strategic redirections for the microfinance field in Asia and elsewhere.

AB  - This study examines the potential of an integrated bio-commodity supply-production center. Previous research has demonstrated the financial viability of circular bio-economies through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or simulation. However, these models 1) do not incorporate the necessary logistics operations for biomass collection and storage, 2) do not integrate and optimize those with the requirements of multi-products line lot sizes. A Geographic Information System (GIS) based model is proposed, integrating insertion and genetic algorithms with a hybrid (ABM-DES) simulation model. A case study in Greece's Fthiotida region, a hub for olive cultivation, investigates the production of pellets, olive cakes, and pomace oil from prunings and Two-Phase Olive Mill Waste (TPOMW). The findings suggest that the model allows for a more accurate estimation of impacts when considering the supply and production operations. In particular, it shows how the frequency and lot sizes of replenishment cycles, influenced by the varying numbers of mechanized harvesters employed, significantly impacts the fluctuation observed in the return on investments. Running the model, it is found that the optimized system with two harvesters can reach a breakeven point, within just 36 months, and corresponding emissions of about 622,041 kgCo2eq. This provides a benchmark for other olive industries to harness unexploited resources.
