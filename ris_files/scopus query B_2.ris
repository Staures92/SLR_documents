AB  - Enterprises operate as complex systems embedded in dynamic environments characterized by global interdependencies, technological advancements, and systemic challenges. This paper examines the critical components, challenges, and resilience strategies necessary for modern organizations to navigate complexity and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage revealed vulnerabilities in interconnected supply chains, financial markets, and digital ecosystems, underscoring the need for systemic adaptability. Technological advancements, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data, add layers of operational complexity, demanding robust data management, cybersecurity measures, and seamless integration with legacy systems. The paper highlights the growing demand for sustainable and ethical practices, driven by regulatory pressures, consumer expectations, and advocacy group influence. Businesses are compelled to balance short-term efficiency with long-term adaptability to thrive in a volatile environment shaped by rapid technological, market, and societal changes. Case studies of organizations such as Toyota, Amazon, and Unilever illustrate how viewing enterprises as interconnected systems allows them to address root causes of challenges, implement resilience strategies, and leverage adaptability as a competitive advantage. Theoretical frameworks, including systems thinking, complex adaptive systems (CAS), and the Viable System Model, provide tools for understanding enterprise complexity. These frameworks emphasize interdependencies, nonlinearities, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors that define organizational systems. The paper explores the concept of resilience, emphasizing adaptability, recovery, and thriving amidst disruptions as critical elements of long-term sustainability. Challenges such as resistance to change, coordination across subsystems, and the trade-off between efficiency and resilience are analyzed within the context of enterprise architecture, Normal Accident Theory, and the Swiss Cheese Model. The study advocates for adopting resilience engineering and collective mindfulness to anticipate, detect, and manage errors effectively, ensuring organizational stability and growth. By framing enterprises as dynamic, adaptive systems, this paper contributes actionable insights for building resilience, fostering sustainability, and managing complexity in an era of unprecedented disruption. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing in the light of the credit crisis and catastrophic climate change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses that the climate change, natural resource shortages, fuel crisis and global financial crisis, etc. will not go away just because there is a recession. In this regard, Shari’ah compliant finance has a broader responsibility to consider societal goals and should be preparing for the post-credit crunch world. The paper evaluates the performance of Shari’ah compliant sustainable funds using the traditional measures of performance in relation to risk-adjusted benchmarks to see if there is any ethical effect. Findings – The paper advocates that preventing future market meltdowns and avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a new era of longterism in Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The study assesses the performance of the Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The result shows that Shari’ah compliant funds outperformed the conventional benchmark and therefore, the challenge for Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing is not to become like conventional investing but, rather, to replace. Research limitations/implications – Shari’ah compliant sustainable finance is a recent phenomena and therefore, rigorous analytical predication of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing variables are at present not possible using evolutionary and complex system approaches; however, such system can be fruitfully studied in future through simulation methods and certain types of econometric modeling when the long-term data will be made available. Originality/value – As the credit crunch has evolved into a full-blown economic crisis, many have turned to the Shari’ah compliant finance to provide a route map out of recession. With an increasing number of conventional banks and corporations struggling to find funds to support their businesses, Shari’ah compliant financial institutions represent a potential solution to bridge the liquidity gap in the global markets. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Food processing industries confront challenges in dealing with wastewater due to seasonal fluctuations. This can lead to potentially untreated wastewater discharge and regulatory non-compliance. Untreated water can also adversely affect the efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment and the local environment. A mobile rental wastewater treatment service for the food processing industry has been proposed as an innovative solution, simultaneously promoting the Circular Economy through water reuse and material recovery. It enables on-demand and on-site wastewater processing, particularly during peak operation. Moreover, it provides additional services for extracting value-added compounds (e.g., polyphenols), delivering further financial benefits. To assess the sustainability of this new business model, this paper presents a hybrid simulation study using agent-based, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis. The hybrid model is applied to a new mobile wastewater service being trialled in the Peloponnesian region of Greece. By considering factors such as customer composition and the volume of wastewater to be treated, logistics (mobile units and hubs), and staggered investments in capacity boosting, the model supports the commercialisation efforts of the rental business model put forward in the case study. The paper contributes to modelling methodology, especially in the use of hybrid simulation within the context of the circular economy of water; it also contributes to the practice of modelling and simulation by exploring their role in assessing the feasibility of novel business models. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effects on the economy of a feed-in tariff policy mechanism aimed to foster investments in renewable energy production capacity. To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water supply and demand management (WSDM) is essential for developing sustainable cities and societies. WSDM is only effective when tackled from the perspective of a holistic system understanding that considers social, environmental, hydrological, and economic (SEHEc) sub-systems. System dynamics modeling (SDM) is recommended by water resource researchers as it models the biophysical and socio-economic systems simultaneously. This study presents a comprehensive literature review of SDM applications in sustainable WSDM. The reviewed articles were methodologically analyzed considering SEHEc sub-systems and the type of modeling approach used. This study revealed that problem conceptualization using the causal loop diagram (CLD) was performed in only 58% of the studies. Moreover, 70% of the reviewed articles used the stock flow diagram (SFD) to perform a quantitative system analysis. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement plays a significant role in understanding the core issues and divergent views and needs of users, but it was incorporated by only 36% of the studies. Although climate change significantly affects water management strategies, only 51% of the reviewed articles considered it. Although the scenario analysis is supported by simulation models, they further require the optimization models to yield optimal key parameter values. One noticeable finding is that only 12% of the articles used quantitative models to complement SDM for the decision-making process. The models included agent-based modeling (ABM), Bayesian networking (BN), analytical hierarchy approach (AHP), and simulation optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO). The solution approaches included the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The key findings for the sustainable development of water resources included the per capita water reduction, water conservation through public awareness campaigns, the use of treated wastewater, the adoption of efficient irrigation practices including drip irrigation, the cultivation of low-water-consuming crops in water-stressed regions, and regulations to control the overexploitation of groundwater. In conclusion, it is established that SDM is an effective tool for devising strategies that enable sustainable water supply and demand management. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Managing grid assets is an ongoing task for electricity distribution network operators (DNOs). Deep uncertainties especially in energy sustainability and flexibility make it difficult to forecast future electricity demand and corresponding grid capacity need. This makes long-term asset replacement strategy planning a complex issue. In this paper, a modeling method that uses the 'sub-grid' concept for supporting DNOs developing strategies is presented. It comprises three main parts: modeling the grid (complex system parameters), modeling demand scenarios as load patterns (uncertain input parameters) and modeling the asset replacement strategies of DNOs (multiple control parameters). Each part is introduced with examples. This method will be applied and further developed in case studies.

AB  - Low coral islands are heavily dependent on groundwater for freshwater supplies. The availability, quality, and management of groundwater are central to sustainable development and poverty alleviation in many developing small island nations. The declaration by the Government of Kiribati of water reserves on the atoll of Tarawa, over privately owned land, has lead to conflicts, illegal settlements and vandalism of public assets. Beside, the water consumption per capita tends to increase towards western-like standards, threatening the sustainability of the actual exploitation system. Finally, pollution generated by the 45 000 habitants of South Tarawa has already contaminated all the freshwater lenses, with the exception of the existing reserves so far. Our project, called AtollGame, aims at providing the relevant information to the local actors, including institutional and local community representatives in order to facilitate the dialogue and devise together sustainable and equitable water management practices. Multi-Agent Based Simulations (MABS) coupled with a Role-Playing Game have been implemented to fulfil this aim. They have the potential to greatly reduce conflict over natural resource management and resource allocation. In order to collect, understand and merge viewpoints coming from different stakeholders, the following 3-stage methodology is applied: collecting local and expert knowledge, blending the different viewpoints into a game-based model, playing the game with the different stakeholders in order to explore different scenarii and their simulated outcomes. Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage of the project is characterised by the upheaval of contradictory Government stands that undermine the whole process. It is argued that heterogeneous viewpoints may be handled in a satisfactory manner during the gaming sessions, but that long-term hidden agendas may override the outcomes. Beyond the inherent question of legitimacy attached to such approaches, it is clear, from our experience, that some players - especially those representing Government or supra-national institutions - have to deal with constraints that are often genuinely first considered as external to the on-going negotiation process.

AB  - Most research about financial stability and sustainable growth focuses on the financial sector and macroeconomics and neglects the real sector, microeconomics and psychology issues. Real-sector and financial-sectors linkages are increasing and are a foundation of economic/social/environmental/urban sustainability, given financial crises, noise, internet, “transition economics”, disintermediation, demographics and inequality around the world. Within complex systems theory framework, this book analyses some multi-sided mechanisms and risk-perception that can have symbiotic relationships with financial stability, systemic risk and/or sustainable growth. Within the context of Regret Minimization, MN-Transferable Utility and WTAL, new theories-of-the-firm are developed that consider sustainable growth, price stability, globalization, financial stability and birth-to-death evolutions of firms. This book introduces new behaviour theories pertaining to real estate and intangibles, which can affect the evolutions of risk-taking and risk perception within organizations and investment entities. The chapters address elements of the dilemma of often divergent risk perceptions of, and risk-taking by corporate executives, regulators and investment managers. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Boarding is one of the major processes of airplane turnaround time, with a direct influence on the airline companies' costs. From a sustainable point of view, a faster completion of the boarding process has impact not only on the airline company's long-term performance, but also on customers' satisfaction and on the airport's possibility of offering more services without additional investments in new infrastructure. Considering the airplane boarding strategies literature, it can be observed that the latest papers are dealing with developing faster boarding strategies, most of them considering boarding using just one-door of the aircraft. Even though boarding on one-door might be feasible for the airports having the needed infrastructure and sufficient jet-bridges, the situation is different in European airports, as the use of apron buses is fairly common. Moreover, some of the airline companies have adapted their boarding pass in order to reflect which door one should board once they get down from the bus. While using these buses, the boarding strategies developed in the literature are hard to find their applicability. Thus, a new method for boarding on two-door airplanes when apron buses are used is proposed and tested against the actual boarding method. A model is created in NetLogo 6.0.4, taking advantages of the agent-based modeling and used for simulations. The results show a boarding time reduction of 8.91%. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - A proper fiscal framework should ensure long-term sustainability while avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal behaviour. In its current form, the European fiscal framework fails on both fronts. Fine-tuning the already complex system is not, in our view, a viable alternative; one has to design a fundamentally new institutional set-up, where accountabilities are clearly defined. Path-dependency should be abandoned and basic theoretical and empirical lessons respected. We propose a decentralised and depoliticised framework, which is theoretically sounder and practically more enforceable than the current web of complicated rules and procedures. Moreover, it also exploits synergies between fiscal rules and independent fiscal institutions at both the national and European levels. The financial and sovereign debt crises have shaken the very foundations of the euro area. In order to calm financial markets, European governments and institutions have adopted a wide variety of reforms and measures to avoid the break-up of the currency union. These trial-and-error and learning-by-doing methods were sometimes successful, but did not always achieve the desired outcomes. Hence there is clear consensus among economists and policymakers that additional steps are necessary to increase the euro area’s resilience to future crises. In what is known as the ‘Five Presidents’ Report’, Juncker et al. (2015) call for progress on four fronts: genuine economic union, financial union, fiscal union and political union. The main objective of this chapter is to contribute to the debate by identifying the weaknesses of the current European fiscal framework and proposing an alternative - more robust - solution. At the heart of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe lies the fundamental contradiction between bail-outs and fiscal sovereignty inside a monetary union. One cannot have both at the same time. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that absent resolution mechanisms and strong links between bank and sovereign risks were the main factors behind the bail-outs in the initial phase of the crisis. Since then, major progress has been made to set up resolution schemes and to present a roadmap towards a banking (financial) union. These are absolutely necessary building blocks of any successful currency union. Creditors and shareholders have to bear a large part of losses stemming from the insolvency of banks or even sovereigns. © L’udovít Ódor 2017.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a topic of national concern as our standing assets and future forests are important to our livelihood. Many tree species are predicted to decline or disappear while others may be able to adapt or migrate. Efforts to quantify and disseminate the current condition of forests are urgently needed to guide management and policy. Here, we develop a new indicator to summarize raw density-independent mortality of forested stands by species from the last decade of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century using forest inventory data. We define density-independent mortality to be stand mortality by species due to processes unrelated to natural mortality from succession or stand maturation, which is marked by overall increase in tree girth at the expense of density of individuals. We assess trends for 22 species on national forests in two U.S. states, Washington and Oregon. Populations of some species including timber species have no or low overall levels of density-independent mortality (Juniperus occidentalis, Abies procera, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii). In contrast, other species demonstrate unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality (Pinus monticola, Arbutus menziesii, Pinus albicaulis, Abies lasiocarpa, Taxus brevifolia, Pinus contorta, Abies grandis, Picea englemanii, and Larix occidentalis). Additionally, the net potential for unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality in standing populations does not necessarily warrant concern when examined across species for our study area and time period; however, when examined by species, the number of species in decline exceeds the number of species where mortality can be generally attributed to endogenous self-thinning. We argue that this work can aid management and policy decisions and our understanding of complex vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. Application of the indicator at larger spatial scales and in conjunction with data on migration and establishment may be used to address questions such as, how can we make cost-effective management decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of tree species and forests? Tree species distributions across the landscape are complex systems, and raw characterization of current trends occurring in forest inventories is important especially given the uncertainty associated with the modeling and prediction of complex systems such as tree species. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Energy efficiency can help facing the climate crises. Yet the energy intensity has decreased more slowly than required to achieve climate goals. Based on this premise, we build an agent-based model to study the effects of different energy efficiency policies. Policies analysed range from indirect policies – taxes, incentives, and subsidies – to direct technological policies, where a public research laboratory invests in R&D to establish a new technological energy efficiency paradigm. Results reveal that, although most of the policies effectively reduce energy intensity, the research lab is the most efficient in promoting energy efficiency without negative impacts on macroeconomic and public finance conditions. However, the success of this policy requires a long-term commitment, highlighting the importance of complementing this strategy with more “ready to use” measures. The findings also indicate that most policies do not induce significant macroeconomic rebound effects. Concerns about macroeconomic rebound effects may likely be overstated. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido–Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This work describes an approach, developed through the use of Agent-Based Modeling, to investigate the financial and technical viability of Next-Generation Networks (NGNs). Bringing to fruition NGNs is such a complex task that new cooperation models among involved players - consistent with the long term sustainability of the large investments required - and innovative tools to describe the complexity of their interactions are necessary. Cooperation and complexity are recurring concepts, in projects established to develop NGNs, where relationships among cooperating entities can not be modeled through linear mathematics and/or classical prediction systems. The modeling and investigation of emergent behaviors performed through the analysis of ad-hoc created, simulation scenarios seems to be one the few ways to perform any meaningful analysis. Among the methods that are becoming more and more popular, today, there is the so called Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), where a complex system is modeled as a dynamic network of autonomous, interacting entities named agents. In this work, the authors present a brief overview of this methodology and discuss the application to the development of NGNs, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, by developing a specific business case to gain insights about the feasibility of modern communication infrastructures - better known as NGNs' programs. The results of the performed investigations show that the level of complexity is so high, for these projects, that new cooperation models among the involved players become a necessity, in order to succeed in achieving the goals to secure both the return of the investment and the attainment of better, advanced communications - thus enabling greater efficiency in business, stronger fulfillment of a fundamental need of individuals, but above all, giving a larger contribution to the development of a better society. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Sustainability of infrastructure systems involves multiple interrelated objectives which are dependent on the dynamic behaviors of stakeholders, interdependencies between infrastructure assets, and evolving conditions in the social and environmental systems. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a framework that integrates: (1) different dimensions of sustainability in infrastructure networks, and (2) dynamic changes in the behaviors of stakeholders, asset performance conditions, and the social and environmental conditions. The proposed framework includes an agent based simulation model to capture the dynamic behaviors of decision makers and the evolving performance of infrastructure assets under different socio-environmental conditions. The outcomes of the simulation model include the short- and long-term costs and environmental impacts of infrastructure networks under different scenarios related to the changes in the socio-environmental conditions. The application of the framework is shown in a numerical case study of a road network. The results include: (i) identification of infrastructure management strategies (e.g., maintenance planning and funding allocation) that optimize the tradeoff between annual cost and environmental impacts of the network; and (ii) discovering robust management strategies that lead to highly-likely desired sustainability outcomes across different uncertain scenarios related to the future socio-environmental conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework for sustainability assessment of infrastructure systems based on integrated analysis of the dynamic behaviors of decision-makers, infrastructure characteristics, and evolving socio-environmental conditions. Hence, it provides a predictive quantitative tool to inform decision-making and policy formulation toward improving the sustainability of infrastructure networks. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming more and more the key challenge for organisations. Sustainability depends on internal and external characteristics of the organisation that should or must be preserved within the time and depends on the definition of what is a suitable state of the system (organisation and its environment) within medium and long terms as safety can be seen as feature of sustainability. The concept of sustainability is a key concept for safety researchers and practitioners. The reverse is true as safety concepts are useful to think sustainability which is still rather new. They share common research grounds on management and organisations sciences. In France, as exemplary organisations, public organisations are working on issues related to both the assessment and governance of sustainability. In this paper we propose a "proactive-based assessment" designed to measure an organisation's ability to govern and achieve sustainability. The proposed assessment method relies on three new concepts: "critical capital" ; Highly Sustainable Organisation (HSO), and learning stages within an HSO.Although there are some elements of unpredictability in complex systems, sustainability for an organisation is based at least on its ability to learn and adapt. There are different ways of conceiving sustainability for public organisations. Even though there is no consensus on the way public organisations are conceived, there is still a philosophical and political agreement on the need for more sustainability. However, it is still unclear and sometimes not even pointed "what should be sustained for public organisations?". We suggest that the "critical capital" is characterised by internal and external aspects of the organisation that should be preserved within the time such as (i) the way of functioning of the organisation, (ii) the way the missions are performed or exercised by the organisation to meet what is contextually referred as being of public and common needs and (iii) the "organisational memory" that represents the identity of the public organisation and the assets of the public organisation. The term "Capital" does not refer to its definition in economy but to its given definitions in sociology (see for example Ferragina, 2010) and ecology (see for example Jansson, 1994). Criticality is fixed "according to the way public service is conceived, to the contextual constraints (such as economical, environmental, social, cultural and ethical) and according to the degree and the nature of threats (natural and manmade hazards).We suggest that organisational sustainability is the ability of the system to preserve and to maintain, within the time, a critical capital and to adapt to its ecosystem. Accordingly, a loss of organisational sustainability indicate whether the organisation is prone to shift to an undesirable organisational state that would decrease the ability or even cease to provide services to the ecosystem and to maintain its identity. In other words, it is an organisation that loses part of its critical capital. Accordingly, we have proposed a development stage model to make explicit the way we have observed in these organisations a common progression in the initiatives they have taken to address sustainability challenges and build learning and innovation capabilities. The three concepts arise from a four years investigation and observation of more than 60 public organisations in France and the coordination, at a national level, of the French working group on "governance of public organisations" that end up with the publication of four national guidelines in March 2013. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms’ investments and households’ house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Switzerland is considering implementing a strategic energy reserve, a novel policy instrument that remunerates power plant operators for storing a minimum amount of energy in reservoirs to convert into electricity when called upon. The policy is envisioned for the winter period, when the country’s large hydropower reservoirs tend to be nearly depleted. This study analyzes the impact of such a strategic energy reserve on security of supply, consumer costs, international trade, and sustainability. A hybrid simulation model is developed that combines agent-based modeling and system dynamics. The simulations show that the reserve can improve short-term security of supply but does not improve long-term security of supply as it does not impact domestic investments or reduce the import dependency in winter. The reserve leads to a slight increase in consumer costs, even when including the reduction in outage costs. A larger reserve is more effective at reducing the supply risk but is proportionally costly. Lastly, we find that the policy induces scarcity periods that would not have occurred otherwise, which means that the reserve should have a high strike price to ensure it is only called upon as a last resort. We conclude that there is no structural need for a strategic energy reserve, as it only increases short-term security of supply and does not contribute to solving the structural problem. Any implementation should be done on an ad hoc basis, conditional on a short-term generation adequacy assessment. This has the potential to minimize the associated costs while maximizing the benefits. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In the context of sustainable development, complex adaptive systems frameworks can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraint and opportunity with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner’s Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then create a new human and nature dynamics agent based model to explore technological progression on population dynamics, economic development, social inequality and use of resources. We investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and societal sustainability. Our initial result shows complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all scales of human behavior and dynamics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - The sustainability of the ongoing Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures. This study uses an empirically based, agent-based model to explore the effect of six scenarios on both area of land covered by, as well as the quality of SWC structures in three Kebeles (villages) of Boset District. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple interventions enhanced SWC most in all Kebeles. Furthermore, increasing the commitment of local government through capacity building generated most effect and yet required the lowest investment. Motivating farmers, introducing alternative livelihood opportunities and establishing and strengthening micro-watershed associations had limited, but differential influence on the outcomes across the Kebeles. However, all alternative scenarios had some added value compared to doing business as usual. Hence, in order to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of the ongoing CBWM program in the study area and other similar localities, it is crucial to pay much more attention to increasing the commitment of local government actors through capacity building. This empowers local government actors to (1) plan and more efficiently imple-ment the program in consultation with other local actors, and (2) integrate locally sensitive need-based adaptation of the program. © 2021, University of Surrey.

AB  - The purpose of this pa\per is to understand the impact of financial key performance indicators (KPIs)—namely customer accounts receivable flow time and credit limit allowed by financial partners—on the financial sustainability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) during business growth trajectories from an operations management perspective. This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent-based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - According to the National Academy of Engineering, innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, alternative fuels, and smart grids are critical to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of infrastructure systems. One key to realizing infrastructure innovations is effective policymaking based on a comprehensive analysis of the system. However, policy analysis in infrastructure systems is difficult because of the existence of complex adaptive behaviors and uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to create an ex-ante analysis framework using Agent-Based simulation to facilitate incorporation of uncertainties and complex adaptive behaviors of stakeholders in the analysis of infrastructure policies. The proposed framework includes three phases: definition, abstraction, and implementation. First, the steps in each phase will be discussed. Then, the application of the framework is demonstrated for the assessment of financial innovation policies for U.S. transportation infrastructure. Using hybrid agent-based/system dynamics techniques, a computational model is created to simulate the micro behaviors of state departments of transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. The results of the model include the visualization of the outcomes of different policies and the identification of the desired policy landscapes. The proposed framework provides policymakers with an integrated methodology through which an infrastructure policy problem is formulated, micro behaviors of the agents are modeled, the policy landscape is created, and the desired scenarios are identified. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The fight against poverty in the Peruvian Andes is a complex task in which various professionals, such as engineers, economists, anthropologists, among others, participate. The uncertainty of the decisions taken today, no matter how appropriate they may seem, such as million-dollar investments in irrigation infrastructure, can result in overproduction and, therefore, in economic recessions. For this reason, a new mathematical simulation model is proposed using system dynamics to predict recession phenomena that can occur in months or after a few years of auspicious economic growth, and that can cause sales prices to be below production costs. The author has developed the conceptualization of the production system of irrigation improvement projects in several years of multidisciplinary work in the Cusco region of Peru. The primary objective of irrigation projects is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the farmer. Techniques as the fulfillment of goals have been used to quantify qualitative dimensions such as strengthening organizations and trainings that are key to guaranteeing irrigation improvement projects' sustainability in the long term. Therefore, it has been possible to identify the variables and relationships of this type of socio-economic system. To validate the model, we verified that the simulated data are consistent with the historical data collected. Likewise, if the values of the various proposed models' variables are adequately modified, these can be applied to other types of production systems under different market conditions. The dimensions addressed, such as supply, demand, sale price, land, production volume, public budget, etc., enhance the research's importance, making the simulation model formally expressed also acquire nuances from economic theory for the fight against poverty-based on water. One of the study's conclusions is to understand the production systems, it is necessary to see them in the context of their regional economy's behavior. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently enacted regulations in Canada and elsewhere require water utilities to be financially self-sustaining over the long-term. This implies full cost recovery for providing water and wastewater services to users. This study proposes a new approach to help water utilities plan to meet the requirements of the new regulations. A causal loop diagram is developed for a financially self-sustaining water utility which frames water and wastewater network management as a complex system with multiple interconnections and feedback loops. The novel System Dynamics approach is used to develop a demonstration model for water and wastewater network management. This is the first known application of System Dynamics to water and wastewater network management. The network simulated is that of a typical Canadian water utility that has under invested in maintenance. Model results show that with no proactive rehabilitation strategy the utility will need to substantially increase its user fees to achieve financial sustainability. This increase is further exacerbated when price elasticity of water demand is considered. When the utility pursues proactive rehabilitation, financial sustainability is achieved with lower user fees. Having demonstrated the significance of feedback loops for financial management of water and wastewater networks, the paper makes the case for a more complete utility model that considers the complexity of the system by incorporating all feedback loops. © 2011.

AB  - During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social–ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social–ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social–ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The coal city is a complex system composed of the subsystems such as population, resource, economic and environment. Sustainability in the coal city depends on the reasonable structure, development pattern of each subsystem and their effective adjustment. The concept of sustainability and the simulation method of system dynamics were combined, the system dynamics model for the coal city was built on the analysis of its' structure. The adjustment parameters such as procreate index, investment ratio of industry and resource recycling rate etc, were confirmed. The typical coal city of Jixi is taken as an example; live future development patterns were designed and run on the model. The simulated results indicate that the sustainable development pattern is the best development pattern for Jixi comparatively. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Energy security has become a worldwide issue in recent years. Coal resources security (CRS), an important part of energy security, has been an emerging concern in many countries, due to the diminishing fossil energy reserve and unbalanced energy structure. However, there is no universally agreed method of constructing indicator system for CRS assessment. Subjectivity in the process of evaluation also affects the results of assessment. Moreover, CRS is a complex system that should be evaluated scientifically under diverse methods. Therefore, we constructed an indicator system and evaluation model of CRS and used a case study of China and 31 provinces in its mainland to evaluate CRS at both national and provincial levels. The indicator system included two subsystems-long-term CRS and short-term CRS. We also chose a few elements and factors that are consistent with China's reality. Different research methods were used: the entropy-weight-based TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is applied to evaluate the degree of CRS, which avoids the subjectivity of weight determination and reflects the relative merit of each indicator; the BP (Back-Propagation) Neural Network method is used to analyze the sensitivity of CRS to each index. The results show that the national level of CRS dropped in the early years but slowly picked up with the help of government intervention. Investment in coal industry development resulted in the immediate effect of improving CRS. The positive impact of maintaining environmental sustainability is stable over either the short, medium, or long term. The degrees of CRS vary significantly across provinces, even between those with similar coal stock levels. Extra attention should be paid to the transportation of coal resources among provinces and intervention to balance supply and demand within the regions. © 2020 by authors.

AB  - The government of Indonesia (GOI) has committed to accelerating electric motorcycles adoption for reducing transport sector emissions. A battery swapping scheme is an attractive option for the GOI to solve several impediments to electric motorcycle adoption related to short milage, charging times, and initial investment costs. However, the battery swapping policy alone seems ineffective in supporting emission reduction targets since Indonesia's grid electricity source is still dominated by fossil energy. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce a green battery swapping concept. It is a concept that integrates the battery swapping scheme with the use of solar energy as its primary energy source for the battery. However, creating a sustainable green battery swapping industry should be assessed as a complex system. Hence, a holistic view is needed to understand the system process and determine the relationship between related elements. This study aims to develop the conceptual model of a sustainable green battery swapping business development using system dynamics modeling. The conceptual model translated into a system diagram and a causal loop diagram (CLD) provides initial information that solar PV capacity, carbon credit, and incentives for charging stations are the main variables impacting the sustainability of a green battery swapping industry. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This paper focuses on the use of system thinking, complex adaptive systems theory and modeling to help create and operate sustainable energy infrastructure. These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) are poised to disrupt travel patterns and the sustainability of transportation networks. Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility. © 2024

AB  - From a public finance point of view, achieving sustainable development hinges on two critical factors: the subnational implementation of public policies and the efficient allocation of resources across regions through vertical intergovernmental transfers. We introduce a framework that links these two mechanisms for analyzing the impact of reallocating federal transfers in the presence of regional heterogeneity from development indicators, budget sizes, expenditure returns, and long-term structural factors. Our study focuses on the case of Mexico and its 32 states. Using an agent-based computational model, we estimate the development gaps that will remain by the year 2030, and characterize their sensitivity to changes in the states’ budget sizes. Then, we estimate the optimal distribution of federal transfers to minimize these gaps. Crucially, these distributions depend on the specific development objectives set by the national government, and by various interdependencies between the heterogeneous qualities of the states. This work sheds new light on the complex problem of budgeting for the Sustainable Development Goals at the subnational level, and it is especially relevant for the study of fiscal decentralization from the expenditure point of view. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The Extended Exergy Analysis (EEA) is an exergy-based accounting method that allows for the internalization of the so-called “externalities” (Labour, Capital and Environmental Cost) neglected by a simple Exergy Analysis (EA). While in Thermoeconomics the cost of each exergy flux is expressed in monetary units, in EEA the measuring basis is the equivalent primary exergy needed to maintain the whole supply chain, “from cradle to grave”; EEA can be considered a de facto “extension” of the Cumulative Exergy Content (CExC) theory. Some recent developments in the way researchers address the sustainability issue confirm that a purely monetary approach may result in misleading conclusions; thence, a purely resource-based method as EEA is a good candidate for the analysis of “energy Conversion” systems at large, because the convenience of a process is not driven solely by monetary profit but requires the quantification of environmental and social factors. This paper introduces a novel approach to EEA, enabled by an extensive basis of relevant information about material-, energy- and monetary fluxes and labour statistics currently available from public and private data banks at a disaggregation level never experienced in the past. A proper organization of this large data set leads to a very detailed and accurate allocation of the material- and immaterial- flows involved in the EEA of a large complex system, like a whole country. The method is useful to make a comparison between the performance of different “transition to sustainability” policies, and it is suitable for a systematic implementation of modular computational procedures; It may thus lead to a rational, unbiased and standardized tool suitable for the conception and evaluation of short- and long-term policies. © Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

AB  - Many regular business operations are transforming into digital services, increasing advanced multi-platforms, rapid operational alignment, flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption, hardware waste, and technology investments. Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study’s findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile’s 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems’ environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In a hyperconnected and turbulent world, resilience has become an essential business competency that strengthens risk management. Resilience is defined as the capacity for complex systems to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of turbulent change, including gradual stresses and sudden shocks. Modern resilience strategies can help enterprises to embrace change rather than clinging to historical practices. By designing both facilities and supply chain processes for increased flexibility, visibility, and agility, organizations can improve their resilience to unforeseen disruptions, thus contributing to profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, resilience often enhances long-term environmental and social sustainability, as in the case of "circular" economic systems that strive to eliminate waste. Through collaboration with global manufacturing firms, a comprehensive protocol has emerged for design of resilient and sustainable systems, along with life cycle-based tools for quantifying the resulting benefits. These methods broaden the system boundary to account for the hidden role of ecosystem services in enterprise operations. For instance, network analysis was used to quantify the contribution of pollination services to economic performance, revealing the indirect dependencies of many industrial sectors on natural pollinators. In another application, climate change scenarios were used in an integrated modeling approach to enable climate-resilient design for two industrial processes-heat exchange and urea manufacturing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Water scarcity invariably poses a threat to the sustainability of cities and rural areas with limited resources, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a new hydro-economic model based on system dynamics and agent-based simulation to enhance the sustainability of urban groundwater. Dynamic pricing was performed based on several parameters, such as resource conditions, price elasticity, consumption history and climate change, to improve the sustainability of groundwater and cover the costs of implementing strategies. Different scenarios based on pricing, rationing, culturalizing, and non-revenue water control strategies were applied in the village of Dehno in Yazd Province as the case study with an arid climate. The results showed that several scenarios can achieve the goal, but, in drought conditions, only a combination of all the strategies will work. © 2021

AB  - Taiwan’s encouragement of installing solar photovoltaic power plants (SPPPs) on warehouse rooftops is a step towards sustainability and profitable investment. This study, analyzing the installations of STY Company, found that rooftop SPPPs significantly boost revenue, with rates increasing from 2.0088% to 6.8681% over 20 years. The break-even point is in the 7th year, with a return rate ranging from 2.0088 to 2.1748%. This shows that SPPP investments are a benefit for investors, shortening construction times and allowing warehouses to sell solar energy at an earlier date. This research utilized a fuzzy nonlinear multi-objective programming model to examine trade-offs between construction time, cost, quality, and revenue (TCQR) to optimize SPPP construction. The findings suggest that reducing construction time is an effective strategy to lower carbon emissions despite potential cost increases. However, time and quality costs are inversely proportional, highlighting the importance of efficient project management in minimizing the impacts of this trade-off. Adjusting funding can maintain quality while speeding up construction. Completing projects early also heightens revenue from green energy sales, offsetting higher initial investments. The TCQR focuses on investment revenue, managing time efficiently, and making data-driven decisions to expedite SPPP development. This model improves project profitability and promotes sustainable growth by reducing construction time and optimizing financial strategies. This study’s contribution includes: 1. Optimizing the installation process of warehouse rooftop SPPPs, which provide significant long-term revenue and environmental benefits. 2. Combining the different research methods of scholars into fuzzy methods that can solve complex systems with high uncertainty. The nonlinear model put forth by this study is closer to the actual situation and can handle balancing complex problems in multi-objective programming. 3. Improving the efficiency of time management to make it feasible to reduce construction time to lower carbon emissions. 4. Concocting a comprehensive approach integrating financial, environmental, and operational factors for successful SPPP development. This study addresses an academic gap. Previously, scholars conducted research independently, focusing solely on financial investment or time, cost, and quality (TCQ) issues without considering the two together. By combining financial investment with TCQ, this study fills a significant gap in academic research. According to this study, better investment returns could improve the promotion of solar energy. Unlike previous research, this study integrates the analysis of TCQ with that of revenue by assessing costs and revenues together. This approach allows decision-makers to derive judgments from the TCQR model quickly. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Simulation and modeling have long served the domain of complex systems such as energy systems. The system of supply and demand of electricity in Canada is highly complex and dynamic in nature. Understanding the causal relationships among the system's nearly immeasurable amount of variables and the patterns that exist in Canada's electricity system is essential for systematic and sustainable policy decisions. Drawing on system dynamics methodology, this study presents a dynamic simulation model. By utilizing the developed and validated system dynamics model, this research finds that, in addition to the traditional adjustment methods, substantial new investments in electricity generation capacity and efficiency enhancement areas are needed to achieve a sustainable and balanced electricity supply and demand system in Canada. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges facing humanity is to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition to public and state financial resources, policymakers leverage private companies to promote sustainable growth through green investments and innovations, encouraging private initiatives and financial activities. In this context, SMEs play a crucial role not only at the European level but also as economic actors implementing and pursuing policy goals. This book focuses on the capital and financial aspects of SME activities for sustainable and inclusive growth, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Starting from a business economics perspective, the book discusses financial instruments for both the short and long term. Supply Chain Finance (SCF) offers a theoretical framework for short-term instruments, improving overall supply chain sustainability through companies’ choices of suppliers, buyers, customers, financial institutions, and technology providers. Innovations such as FinTechs and Blockchain can enhance the effectiveness of sustainable business and bring about substantial changes in relationships among different actors. With regard to long-term instruments like debt capital, the book analyzes the traditional banking channel along with the role of the financial market. Factors such as the impact of FinTechs and other innovations on market efficiency have the potential to change financing activities, making relationships more complex and binding. In this complex system, new laws and regulations can mean sudden changes in terms of providing loans. The banking sector is increasingly using CSR drivers to assess creditworthiness and integrating green lending into credit policy, in keeping with central bank decisions and international board standards. These rules supplement existing ones on prudential supervision, capital buffers, and the broader international regulatory framework for banks. Lastly, the book explores the potential impact of “greenwashing” on SMEs pursuing sustainable practices. To address this, it proposes an approach to measuring sustainability for Italian SMEs based on a survey of 2500 enterprises and provides Matlab tools for investigating green and other sustainable behaviors. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - In this paper, health information exchange (HIE) adoption barriers, challenges, influencing factors, and the impacts of policy interventions among ambulatory providers and acute-hospitals in the State of Maryland health care system are examined. The main areas discussed are HIE sustainability, financial benefits, return on investment, and the correlation between HIE and hospital readmission reductions. The proposed policies include financial incentives to adopt HIE (policy 1), awareness and education to integrate HIE into the workflow (policy 2), and a combination of policies 1 and 2 to address the most frequent barriers identified in the literature. System dynamics simulation modeling combined with statistical analyses were utilized based on monthly time-series datasets. The design for each policy was developed considering HIE adoption barriers, challenges, and influencing variables. The simulation focused on presenting the findings of many HIE adoption studies. The results suggested significant financial advantages of using HIE (an approximately $3.3 billion cumulative gain over 10 years). Ambulatory provider adoption of HIE is slow but contributes the most to the overall HIE portal queries. Three datasets were analyzed with regard to hospital readmission reductions, HIE portal query usage, and encounter-notification service alerts. Strong positive correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.8, respectively, were determined. Finally, the designed policy interventions (policy 1, policy 2, and combination) showed a positive effect on HIE adoption rate by 15.87%, 8.36% and 21.17% respectively. This research can be used as a framework to provide policy makers and strategic thinkers with a methodology for analyzing such complex systems and generate well informed HIE adoption policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Various types of 'bubbles', e.g. stock market, housing, dot.com, high-tech, historically, are commonlyobserved phenomena in complex systems. Yet, their emergence often surprises people who remain unaware of history or their systemic roots. Bubbles are often considered to be simply the product of unwise speculative investments or social mania. Alternatively, conventional economic theories often consider factors, such as interest rates, to be the trigger. However, economic theories rarely account for the systemic structure of markets or for non-linear dynamics. The authors propose that special cases may emerge in some markets to trigger instability. Specifically, when minimal interest rates and capital requirements (down payments) are become extremely low a perceptual shift occurs among consumers such that they become viewed as approximate free goods. This paper proposes that unwise economic policies may activate a free goods scenario initiating a cascading series of destabilizing events leading to market collapse. The authors propose hypothesize that such incendiary policies caused both the 1929 stock market crash and the 2008 subprime housing crisis in the United States. To more deeply examine this claim, these policies were tested using a system dynamics model based on data from both the 1929 and 2008 crises. The model simulated and tested the effects of alternative rate policies on market dynamics. Some of the rates and down payments used in both crises set off tsunami-like shock waves through markets leading to their sudden collapse in these simulations. Based on the findings of this study, found that economic policies lessened market stability. The authors propose several revisions to these policies to foster greater market sustainability. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - System thinking is the approach required to understand and analyse complex systems. When systems are complex, their essential properties emerge from the interaction and relationships between parts that cannot be isolated. In such a context, the sustainability challenge requires a mutual synergy between markets and governments to lead the world toward long term prosperity. In order to approach sustainability with a chance of success, it must be seen as multidisciplinary challenge involving different systems interconnected through mutual feedbacks. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to adopt a hybrid approach composed of Agent Based and System Dynamics that: i) analyses the redesign of companies based on industrial symbiosis strategies, and ii) the impact of specific policies on the transition to industrial symbiosis. Results show that industrial symbiosis lies at the core of the positive feedback loop which can support transitioning towards a zero-waste economy. The larger the number of firms adopting symbiosis, the greater the reduction in waste disposal costs and profits and the greater the number of firms engaging in the transition. Policy making can both amplify or reduce the feedback effect by means of public investments and/or tax incentives. The model allows for testing different assumptions in the industrial system while generating a top-down perspective to take effective policies towards a zero-waste economy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - According to the National Academy of Engineering, innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, alternative fuels, smart grids, and financial innovations are critical to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of infrastructure systems. The key to expansion of infrastructure innovations is effective policymaking. This paper adopts an Innovation System-of-Systems framework for policymakers to analyze innovation policies in interdependent infrastructure systems. The System-of-Systems framework facilitates consideration of the adaptive micro-behaviors of the components of the system within and across different levels of analysis. The application of the framework is demonstrated for the assessment of financial innovation policies for U.S. transportation infrastructure. Using hybrid Agent-based/System Dynamics techniques, a complex system model is created to simulate the micro-behaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Different policy landscapes are developed using the output of the simulation model and classification and regression tree analysis as a meta-model. The quality of the model outcomes are evaluated through conceptual model validity, data validity, internal validity, and sensitivity analysis. The model provides policymakers with a tool to: (i) consider the effects of parameters in a complex system simultaneously and (ii) simulate the landscape of possible outcomes due to different policies. © ASCE 2012.

AB  - This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation. © 2009 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.

AB  - The eco-economic system is a complex system based on human activities, and the sustainability of the eco-economic system needs to maintain the balance between the three subsystems of society, economy, and environment. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation index system of the ecological-economic system of Liaoning Province in China was constructed by combining the emergy analysis and the system dynamic (SD) model, and four development scenarios were designed by adjusting the influencing factors of the ecological-economic system, based on the simulation and evaluation of the sustainable ecological and economic development of Liaoning Province from 2017 through to the next 19 years. The conclusion shows that, under the scenario of coordinated development type, the GDP, emergy density, and emergy output rate of Liaoning Province show an increasing trend; the ecological load, such as waste emergy ratio and environmental load rate, is small; and the sustainable development index and emergy sustainable development index are at a high level compared to other programs. © 2022 by the authors.
