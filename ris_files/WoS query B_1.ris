AB  - Water scarcity invariably poses a threat to the sustainability of cities and rural areas with limited resources, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a new hydro-economic model based on system dynamics and agent-based simulation to enhance the sustainability of urban groundwater. Dynamic pricing was performed based on several parameters, such as resource conditions, price elasticity, consumption history and climate change, to improve the sustainability of groundwater and cover the costs of implementing strategies. Different scenarios based on pricing, rationing, culturalizing, and non-revenue water control strategies were applied in the village of Dehno in Yazd Province as the case study with an arid climate. The results showed that several scenarios can achieve the goal, but, in drought conditions, only a combination of all the strategies will work.

AB  - In the context of sustainable development, complex adaptive systems frameworks can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraint and opportunity with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner's Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then create a new human and nature dynamics agent based model to explore technological progression on population dynamics, economic development, social inequality and use of resources. We investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and societal sustainability. Our initial result shows complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all scales of human behavior and dynamics.

AB  - During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social-ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social-ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social-ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy.

AB  - This paper focuses on the use of system thinking, complex adaptive systems theory and modeling to help create and operate sustainable energy infrastructure. These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given.

AB  - This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation.

AB  - Energy efficiency can help facing the climate crises. Yet the energy intensity has decreased more slowly than required to achieve climate goals. Based on this premise, we build an agent-based model to study the effects of different energy efficiency policies. Policies analysed range from indirect policies - taxes, incentives, and subsidies - to direct technological policies, where a public research laboratory invests in R&D to establish a new technological energy efficiency paradigm. Results reveal that, although most of the policies effectively reduce energy intensity, the research lab is the most efficient in promoting energy efficiency without negative impacts on macroeconomic and public finance conditions. However, the success of this policy requires a long-term commitment, highlighting the importance of complementing this strategy with more "ready to use"measures. The findings also indicate that most policies do not induce significant macroeconomic rebound effects. Concerns about macroeconomic rebound effects may likely be overstated.

AB  - The eco-economic system is a complex system based on human activities, and the sustainability of the eco-economic system needs to maintain the balance between the three subsystems of society, economy, and environment. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation index system of the ecological-economic system of Liaoning Province in China was constructed by combining the emergy analysis and the system dynamic (SD) model, and four development scenarios were designed by adjusting the influencing factors of the ecological-economic system, based on the simulation and evaluation of the sustainable ecological and economic development of Liaoning Province from 2017 through to the next 19 years. The conclusion shows that, under the scenario of coordinated development type, the GDP, emergy density, and emergy output rate of Liaoning Province show an increasing trend; the ecological load, such as waste emergy ratio and environmental load rate, is small; and the sustainable development index and emergy sustainable development index are at a high level compared to other programs.

AB  - The sustainability of the ongoing Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures. This study uses an empirically based, agent-based model to explore the effect of six scenarios on both area of land covered by, as well as the quality of SWC structures in three Kebeles (villages) of Boset District. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple interventions enhanced SWC most in all Kebeles. Furthermore, increasing the commitment of local government through capacity building generated most effect and yet required the lowest investment. Motivating farmers, introducing alternative livelihood opportunities and establishing and strengthening micro-watershed associations had limited, but differential influence on the outcomes across the Kebeles. However, all alternative scenarios had some added value compared to doing business as usual. Hence, in order to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of the ongoing CBWM program in the study area and other similar localities, it is crucial to pay much more attention to increasing the commitment of local government actors through capacity building. This empowers local government actors to (1) plan and more efficiently implement the program in consultation with other local actors, and (2) integrate locally sensitive need-based adaptation of the program.

AB  - A debt-based economy requires the accumulation of more and more debt to finance economic growth, while future economic growth is needed to repay the debt, and so the cycle continues. Despite global debt reaching unprecedented levels, little research has been done to understand the impacts of debt dynamics on environmental sustainability. Here, we explore the environmental impacts of the debt-growth cycle in Indonesia, the world's largest debt-based producer of palm oil. Our empirical Agent-Based Model analyses the future effects (2018-2050) of power (im)balance scenarios between debt-driven economic forces (i.e. banks, firms), and conservation forces, on two ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation) and biodiversity. The model shows the trade-offs and synergies among these indicators for Business As Usual as compared to alternative scenarios. Results show that debt-driven economic forces can partially support environmental conservation, provided the state's role in protecting the environment is reinforced. Our analysis provides a lesson for developing countries that are highly dependent on debt-based production systems: sustainable development pathways can be achievable in the short and medium terms; however, reaching long-term sustainability requires reduced dependency on external financial powers, as well as further government intervention to protect the environment from the rough edges of the market economy.

AB  - Indonesia has reevaluated its archipelagic logistics system to implement a strategic shift from a point-to-point network to a hub-and-spoke network, with a plan to establish seven new regional distribution centers (RDCs). To supplement the previous qualitative assessment of the plan and to potentially justify continuing with its implementation, this paper aims to evaluate the prospective long-term performance of the planned RDCs within a hub-and-spoke (HS) network. The chosen methodology for this analysis is a hybrid of optimization and simulation, using an agent-based modeling and simulation platform that incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) element to provide a realistic geographical context. This constitutes a relatively novel innovation in logistics research. Experiments were developed to estimate the logistics performance of the hub-and-spoke network and planned RDCs, as well as to identify potential problems such as bottlenecks at the RDCs and the relative (in)efficiency of the selected multimodal transport. Transport costs, inventory costs, and the order backlog of RDCs are evaluated based on the average results from 100 replications. Outcomes from the model are validated against empirical data on Indonesia's logistics costs from the World Bank. Model results indicate that the hub-and-spoke network performs better than the point-to-point network when it comes to transportation costs. Since this is found to be the dominant element of total logistics costs, appropriate modal choice and route optimization are, therefore, critical to reducing logistics costs. The planned RDCs are found to have significant imbalance in their loadings, which is likely to produce bottlenecks. The paper concludes that a planned move to a hub-and spoke system is appropriate and that the planned investment in the RDCs is therefore justified. However, there is a need to streamline the predicted loadings at the RDCs to avoid bottlenecks. Our results suggest that the government should reopen the case and reevaluate the locations and coverage of each RDC. More generically, it is concluded that the application of hybrid optimization and simulation using agent-based modeling and simulation is feasible and the methodological approach adopted herein is generalizable to other archipelagic logistics systems.

AB  - Urban rail transit (URT) public-private partnership (PPP) projects are long-term, complex projects involving numerous stakeholders. Various unforeseeable events make the benefits of these projects uncertain, and disputes about the distribution and adjustment of benefits can seriously threaten project success. Therefore, there is a pressing need to effectively evaluate the project benefits available to various stakeholders and design a dynamic benefit-adjustment mechanism to ensure the successful completion of URT PPP projects. In full consideration of the complexities of projects of this nature and the adaptive behaviors of different stakeholders, a modeling framework was proposed to simulate the realization and dynamic adjustment of project benefits as a complex and comprehensive system defined by the microlevel dynamic behaviors of stakeholders and interactions among these behaviors through agent-based modeling (ABM). The framework was utilized to emulate a real-world URT PPP project for demonstration purposes. Next, two scenarios were simulated that considered the effects of the purchase behavior of the public and decisions concerning benefit adjustment on project benefits. The framework is a powerful decision support tool with regard to the benefits of URT PPP projects in that it can promote the maximization of overall benefits and the sustainability of URT projects.

AB  - Boarding is one of the major processes of airplane turnaround time, with a direct influence on the airline companies' costs. From a sustainable point of view, a faster completion of the boarding process has impact not only on the airline company's long-term performance, but also on customers' satisfaction and on the airport's possibility of offering more services without additional investments in new infrastructure. Considering the airplane boarding strategies literature, it can be observed that the latest papers are dealing with developing faster boarding strategies, most of them considering boarding using just one-door of the aircraft. Even though boarding on one-door might be feasible for the airports having the needed infrastructure and sufficient jet-bridges, the situation is different in European airports, as the use of apron buses is fairly common. Moreover, some of the airline companies have adapted their boarding pass in order to reflect which door one should board once they get down from the bus. While using these buses, the boarding strategies developed in the literature are hard to find their applicability. Thus, a new method for boarding on two-door airplanes when apron buses are used is proposed and tested against the actual boarding method. A model is created in NetLogo 6.0.4, taking advantages of the agent-based modeling and used for simulations. The results show a boarding time reduction of 8.91%.

AB  - To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido-Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy.

AB  - Early and deep electricity decarbonisation is critical to achieve the overall energy transition target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This paper extends an electricity agent based model to capture the inter-dependence of consistent governance with underpinning societal pressure and resultant investment strategies. Results show only with the strongest level of governance - reflected in the range of national/local policy mechanisms used, and their strength/timing when interim targets are met/missed - can near-zero electricity emissions be met well before 2050. Strong governance can also ensure a stable electricity system, with consistent policies mitigating the intensity of any investment cycles. Strong governance entails higher capital investments, but these can deliver lower electricity prices in the long-term. And strong governance means that a successful electricity decarbonisation does not need to be built solely on existing incumbents, but also via local cooperatives to aggregate household financing and demand side management. However, with inconsistent governance, a vicious cycle ensues with a weak rationale to enact ambitious policies at both the local and national levels, significant inertia in new electricity investments, and hence "failure" scenarios of decarbonisation. This challenges the prior findings of optimistic achievement of electricity decarbonisation scenarios by standard techno-economic optimisation models.

AB  - Across the world, cities are spending billions of dollars to manage urban runoff through decentralized green infrastructure (GI). This research uses an agent-based model to explore some of the physical, social, and economic consequences of one such urban GI programs. Using the Bronx, NY, as a case study, two alternative approaches to GI application are compared. The first (Model 1) mimics NYC's current GI program by opportunistically selecting sites for GI within the city's priority combined sewer watersheds; the second (Model 2) features a more spatially flexible approach to GI siting, in which the city attempts to maximize opportunities for co-benefits within the geographic areas considered in Model 1. The effects of both approaches, measured in terms of stormwater captured and co-benefits (e.g., carbon sequestered) provided, are tracked over 20-year simulations. While both models suggest it will be difficult to meet the citywide stormwater capture goals (managing the first 2.5 cm of rainfall from 10% of impervious surfaces) in the Bronx solely through public investment in GI, Model 2 shows that by integrating GI with other city initiatives (e.g., sustainability goals and resilience planning), synergistic outcomes are possible. Specifically, Model 2 produces stormwater capture rates comparable to those obtained under Model 1, but these rates are accompanied by elevated co-benefits for Bronx communities. The results are discussed in the context of future GI policy development in NYC.

AB  - Bees and beekeeping are increasingly recognised as important contributors to sustainable development. Beekeeping is a landscape-scale process that involves complex interconnectivities between beekeepers, beehives and bee forage. Yet, accounting for these interactions within beekeeping system models is challenging as in-teractions are dynamic and often influenced by human behaviour and decision making. To this end, this research describes a spatially explicit modelling approach B-Agent, which draws upon multiple stakeholder engagement, a machine-learning algorithm and an agent-based model to simulate beehive migration processes. The Western Australian beekeeping sector provides a case study for model development and testing, to examine changes in (i) distances travelled by beekeepers, (ii) the frequency of beehive migration, and (iii) the spatial distribution of harvest locations resulting from climate related impacts on forage availability. The results indicate an increase in travel distance and frequency of hive migrations for commercial beekeepers under a moderate emissions climate scenario and indicated an eastward shift in the spatial distribution of harvest locations. The approach provides an evidence-base for better-informed management decisions in order to improve the long-term sustainability of beekeeping systems in Western Australia and beyond.

AB  - Water supply and demand management (WSDM) is essential for developing sustainable cities and societies. WSDM is only effective when tackled from the perspective of a holistic system understanding that considers social, environmental, hydrological, and economic (SEHEc) sub-systems. System dynamics modeling (SDM) is recommended by water resource researchers as it models the biophysical and socio-economic systems simultaneously. This study presents a comprehensive literature review of SDM applications in sustainable WSDM. The reviewed articles were methodologically analyzed considering SEHEc sub-systems and the type of modeling approach used. This study revealed that problem conceptualization using the causal loop diagram (CLD) was performed in only 58% of the studies. Moreover, 70% of the reviewed articles used the stock flow diagram (SFD) to perform a quantitative system analysis. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement plays a significant role in understanding the core issues and divergent views and needs of users, but it was incorporated by only 36% of the studies. Although climate change significantly affects water management strategies, only 51% of the reviewed articles considered it. Although the scenario analysis is supported by simulation models, they further require the optimization models to yield optimal key parameter values. One noticeable finding is that only 12% of the articles used quantitative models to complement SDM for the decision-making process. The models included agent-based modeling (ABM), Bayesian networking (BN), analytical hierarchy approach (AHP), and simulation optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO). The solution approaches included the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The key findings for the sustainable development of water resources included the per capita water reduction, water conservation through public awareness campaigns, the use of treated wastewater, the adoption of efficient irrigation practices including drip irrigation, the cultivation of low-water-consuming crops in water-stressed regions, and regulations to control the overexploitation of groundwater. In conclusion, it is established that SDM is an effective tool for devising strategies that enable sustainable water supply and demand management.

AB  - From a public finance point of view, achieving sustainable development hinges on two critical factors: the subnational implementation of public policies and the efficient allocation of resources across regions through vertical intergovernmental transfers. We introduce a framework that links these two mechanisms for analyzing the impact of reallocating federal transfers in the presence of regional heterogeneity from development indicators, budget sizes, expenditure returns, and long-term structural factors. Our study focuses on the case of Mexico and its 32 states. Using an agent-based computational model, we estimate the development gaps that will remain by the year 2030, and characterize their sensitivity to changes in the states' budget sizes. Then, we estimate the optimal distribution of federal transfers to minimize these gaps. Crucially, these distributions depend on the specific development objectives set by the national government, and by various interdependencies between the heterogeneous qualities of the states. This work sheds new light on the complex problem of budgeting for the Sustainable Development Goals at the subnational level, and it is especially relevant for the study of fiscal decentralization from the expenditure point of view.

AB  - Farm production often involves family-owned agribusinesses where decisions are made by households or individuals, not corporate managers. As these decisions have important economic, environmental, and social implications, decision-making processes must be understood to foster sustainable agricultural production. Decision experiments, involving lotteries, targeting farmers in the Argentine Pampas were used to estimate prospect theory (PT) parameters. Results suggest that decisions under risk are better represented by prospect theory than by expected utility (EU) theory: Decision makers treat gains and losses differently and use subjective probabilities of outcomes; they are quite loss averse and are more likely to overweigh probabilities of infrequent events, such as large droughts or floods. Statistical testing revealed heterogeneity in the risk tied to land tenure (land owners vs. renters) and agribusiness roles (farmers vs. technical advisors). Perceptions of risk, probability, and outcomes played a large role in the sustainability of production. Due to a strong desire to avoid losses, decision makers have a greater short term focus: Immediate economic outcomes are more salient, and environmental and social investments are framed as costs rather than long-term gains. This research can help design policies, programs, and tools that assist agribusinesses in managing better contradictions across the triple bottom line to ensure greater sustainability.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effects on the economy of a feed-in tariff policy mechanism aimed to foster investments in renewable energy production capacity. To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path.

AB  - Industrial symbiosis is a promising business model that pushes companies to move from linear production to a circular path. However, this transformation is complex because it requires companies to rethink and redesign their supply chains by considering the involvement of new stakeholders, the introduction of waste and their impact on product development, economic investments, and technological resources. As a result, companies need innovative modelling tools able to capture, investigate, and quantify the results of these changes and to work on the strategic planning, design, implementation, and management of their industrial symbiosis networks. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the most used modelling approaches to analyse industrial symbiosis, and to research their characteristics in terms of simulation methods, interaction mechanisms, and simulations software. Findings from our research suggest that an Agent-Based System Dynamics hybrid approach is an appropriate method for industrial symbiosis design and analysis. The paper also presents a theoretical framework that aims at supporting researchers and practitioners approaching industrial symbiosis and, in conclusion, a research agenda is suggested for scholars.

AB  - We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms' investments and households' house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate.

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) are poised to disrupt travel patterns and the sustainability of transportation networks. Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility.

AB  - Faced with the degraded ecological environment, it is necessary to optimize the energy structure and interregional energy trade framework to achieve sustainable and balanced development. A RIMSP-based energy structure balance development model is proposed to solve the contradictions among energy consumption, economic system cost, and ecological emissions. In this study, the systemic risks and uncertainties are considered through integrating the Conditional Value at Risk module, Interval Programming, Multi-Stage stochastic Programming, and Integer Programming. A typical region with unbalanced energy endowments and economic development, Shanxi Province, China was investigated to illustrate the model applicability and superiority. It is found that the probability of system failures can be controlled within 1% and the most stable energy system will be found when risk weighted coefficient at 20. The optimal power generation schemes can be obtained for target power generation stage with compensation mechanism and for recourse power generation stage with substitution ratio of 20%, 15%, and 10% at three planning periods, respectively. The total installed capacity of clean energy is expected to reach approximately 41.4% by 2035. Wind power and solar power have more advantages than natural gas power in responding to flexible power demand and long-term sustainable requirements. In addition, the emissions of Particulate Matter, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrogen Oxide, and Carbon Dioxide would be reduced to varying degrees. The results can provide a solid scientific basis for formulating balanced development policies to restore the ecological environment related to energy consumption.

AB  - Low coral islands are heavily dependent on groundwater for freshwater supplies. The availability, quality, and management of groundwater are central to sustainable development and poverty alleviation in many developing small island nations. The declaration by the Government of Kiribati of water reserves on the atoll of Tarawa, over privately owned land, has lead to conflicts, illegal settlements and vandalism of public assets. Beside, the water consumption per capita tends to increase towards western-like standards, threatening the sustainability of the actual exploitation system. Finally, pollution generated by the 45 000 habitants of South Tarawa has already contaminated all the freshwater lenses, with the exception of the existing reserves so far.
   Our project, called AtollGame, aims at providing the relevant information to the local actors, including institutional and local community representatives in order to facilitate the dialogue and devise together sustainable and equitable water management practices. Multi-Agent Based Simulations (MABS) coupled with a Role-Playing Game have been implemented to fulfil this aim.
   They have the potential to greatly reduce conflict over natural resource management and resource allocation. In order to collect, understand and merge viewpoints coming from different stakeholders, the following 3-stage methodology is applied: collecting local and expert knowledge, blending the different viewpoints into a game-based model, playing the game with the different stakeholders in order to explore different scenarii and their simulated outcomes.
   Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage of the project is characterised by the upheaval of contradictory Government stands that undermine the whole process. It is argued that heterogeneous viewpoints may be handled in a satisfactory manner during the gaming sessions, but that long-term hidden agendas may override the outcomes. Beyond the inherent question of legitimacy attached to such approaches, it is clear, from our experience, that some players - especially those representing Government or supra-national institutions - have to deal with constraints that are often genuinely first considered as external to the on-going negotiation process.

AB  - The coal city is a complex system composed of the subsystems such as population, resource, economic and environment. Sustainability in the coal city depends on the reasonable structure, development pattern of each subsystem and their effective adjustment. The concept of sustainability and the simulation method of system dynamics were combined, the system dynamics model for the coal city was built on the analysis of its' structure. The adjustment parameters such as procreate index, investment ratio of industry and resource recycling rate etc, were confirmed. The typical coal city of Jixi is taken as an example; five future development patterns were designed and run on the model. The simulated results indicate that the sustainable development pattern is the best development pattern for Jixi comparatively.

AB  - Long term uncertainties in combination with long lifetime of assets of drinking water infrastructures (DWIs) and changing expectations of stakeholders make strategic decisions in drinking water infrastructures (DWIs) complex. A framework with building blocks and design spaces was developed to support these decisions. Building blocks, divided in governance and system properties, were generic resilience enhancing design principles found in literature. The design spaces were defined by characteristics (water quantity, water quality and environmental impact), and the scale dimension. The DWI design principles framework was operationalised in a case study. The case showed that the DWI design principles framework was useful for strategic issues and the results were recognised and accepted by a diverse group of stakeholders. It may also be possible to apply the framework for other water infrastructures with comparable characteristics and dimensions.

CP  - 45th International Seminar on Nuclear War and Planetary Emergencies
AB  - Arguably, the most acute energy emergency today is associated with the rapid growth of cities, most notably in Asia and Africa. The populations of all cities are growing rapidly, and two-thirds of the global population will live in large cities by 2050. Economic, political, and social entities are important elements of cities, which are complex systems in themselves, but energy issues tend to be afterthoughts. Energy in itself is a large and complex system and is the "glue" that holds an entire city system together, and energy must be integrated equally into the mix, in planning as well as execution. Energy's full integration provides an opportunity to substantially contribute to discussions and lead to city solutions going forward, and by extrapolation to the sustainability of the entire planet. Issues such as energy-efficient technologies, policies, regulations and their enforcement, energy services, and communication all need to be part of the solution. These problems are amenable to the new science of modelling and controllability of complex networks, with a real promise of new insights and the identification of unanticipated patterns and key control points using statistical physics and non-linear dynamics.
   In working on energy and cities, it is important to interact with the entities already involved in other parts of the system. Productive interactions logically begin with the mayors of cities. Public-private partnerships already exist and the private sector must be engaged. The financial community is critical and capital investment firms must also be involved. Last but not least, national governments have a role to play by offering long-term technology development and financial incentives.

To do so, we first define the concept of transformative targets from a complex systems perspective and show a novel approach and original results using an extended application of the GEM-E3 model. Traditional macroeconomic models cannot easily handle key synergetic system effects derived from green growth and sustainability policies, and thus require additional features. We analyse the role of semi-endogenous growth driven by learning-by-doing and low-carbon investment expectations following a long-term transformative trajectory.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a topic of national concern as our standing assets and future forests are important to our livelihood. Many tree species are predicted to decline' or disappear while others may be able to adapt or migrate. Efforts to quantify and disseminate the current condition of forests are urgently needed to guide management and policy. Here, we develop a new indicator to summarize raw density-independent mortality of forested stands by species from the last decade of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century using forest inventory data. We define density-independent mortality to be stand mortality by species due to processes unrelated to natural mortality from succession or stand maturation, which is marked by overall increase in tree girth at the expense of density of individuals. We assess trends for 22 species on national forests in two U.S. states, Washington and Oregon. Populations of some species including timber species have no or low overall levels of density-independent mortality (Juniperus occidentalis, Abies procera, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii). In contrast, other species demonstrate unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality (Pinus monticola, Arbutus menziesii, Pinus albicaulis, Abies lasiocarpa, Taxus brevifolia, Pinus contorta, Abies grandis, Picea englemanii, and Larix occidentalis). Additionally, the net potential for unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality in standing populations does not necessarily warrant concern when examined across species for our study area and time period; however, when examined by species, the number of species in decline exceeds the number of species where mortality can be generally attributed to endogenous self-thinning. We argue that this work can aid management and policy decisions and our understanding of complex vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. Application of the indicator at larger spatial scales and in conjunction with data on migration and establishment may be used to address questions such as, how can we make cost-effective management decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of tree species and forests? Tree species distributions across the landscape are complex systems, and raw characterization of current trends occurring in forest inventories is important especially given the uncertainty associated with the modeling and prediction of complex systems such as tree species.

AB  - As a social and environmental-sensitive industry, garment firms are trying to implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) to cope with the increasing pressure of public concerns for globalised socially responsible supply chains (SC). We build such a model by using the System Dynamics (SD) approach. With the mechanism of mutual interactions between different variables of a complex system, our study examines different conditions of CSR implementation in the SC under which it is profitable for SC actors. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that when CSR implementation can stabilise market demand, firms' CSR investment is beneficial. Our study provides a theoretical and managerial foundation that may be used to strengthen the consideration of CSR engagement in the garment SC. By analysing the covariance of factors influencing decision making to implement CSR strategies, our approach allows SC managers to make CSR decisions and production management. Furthermore, the model provides tools for evaluating and forecasting the effectiveness of their CSR strategies according to industry specifics.

AB  - Meeting its climate policy objectives requires the UK to rapidly decarbonise its energy sector. This demands high levels of investments into low carbon energy infrastructure, which are currently not undertaken at required scale, leading to a green finance gap. We explore (1) key investment barriers, (2) a theoretical framework for investigation and (3) possible solutions, drawing on a review of academic literature and policy reports, and interviews conducted with financial investors and experts. Our study confirms that policy uncertainty and short-termism in the financial system are the two main investment barriers. Our results show that identified barriers form a complex system characterised by path-dependency, lock-in and non-linearity. We recommend the adoption of systems theory as an analytical framework to inform the related policy debate and propose the expansion or development of sustainable investment vehicles as a useful near-term solution while preparing a long-term policy intervention based on a systems perspective.

AB  - Sustainability defines itself with preserving the natural resources, while maintaining a sustained rate of economic growth. Latin American countries are rich in natural resources and this has created an opportunity in exploiting the resources in order to gain economic advances. In particular, the newly rising economic powers in the region are attracting international investments in their oil exploration and production industries. Brazil, Venezuela and Columbia in South and Mexico in North America are among the largest Latin American oil producers of the world.
   On the other hand, the increasingly concerning effects of the climate change phenomena has drawn significant attention towards methods of controlling the roots of the problem. An important cause as confirmed by the historic emissions data is the man-made Greenhouse Gas emissions resulting from excessive use of fossil fuels, and more importantly the carbon-intensive coal and oil. In this paper, we investigate the possible impacts of an emission control system on Latin American oil producers to control the rate of emissions through a financial market which is referred to as the carbon market. Variations of this system has successfully been implemented in the Europe and some states of the US, such as the state of California. Our approach is based on the system dynamics methodology where the main factors of a complex system are extracted and their causal relations are exploited to obtain mathematical models that can explain the behaviors of overall system. The general tools provided by the system dynamics approach for policy testing makes it very appealing for our purpose which is to test the effect of a carbon market on the Latin American producers. We extend our previous models to fit the Latin American economies focusing on the sustainability issues.

AB  - Public employee pension management is the nexus of public and private financial management systems that are significant long-term components of public finance. The idea that these pension systems can look quite similar yet perform in quite different and conflicting ways is significant when designing policy; system design templates are not successful in complex systems. Even pension systems within the same city can have radically different states of actuarial health based upon small differences in the rules (or adherence to the rules) establishing them. To better understand such systems, viewing them from a common pool resource perspective is useful. Elinor Ostrom (1990), in her seminal book Governing the Commons, provides eight principles that facilitate governing common pool resources. The general theme running through Ostrom's principles is the need to facilitate the building and channeling of social capital. By facilitating constructive collective choice, the goal of effective, sustainable collective action is achievable. In this study, we examine the political, cultural, and institutional structures that are in place in the pension systems of Dallas and Houston, Texas. We examine the pensions' governance practices to determine which appear to violate Ostrom's ideal institutional arrangements and their impact on the pensions' long-term sustainability. Pertinent survey information from pension beneficiaries conducted as part of this research are provided

AB  - Bioeconomy has been incorporated into the national strategy for sustainable development by many countries, and the concept of biorefinery has been considered as one of the essential components of such strategies. The environmental, economic, and social implications of a biorefinery hinge upon both the endogenous interactions among its supply chain components and their responses to the exogenous factors. The system dynamics (SD) modeling approach is suitable for understanding such complex systems. This study provides a state-of-the-art review of the methodological assumptions of existing SD studies relevant to the sustainability of biorefineries. Among the reviewed studies, common supply chain components of a biorefinery were feedstock supply, biomass conversion, market demand, distribution, and use of bioproducts. Components of a supply chain are interlinked through feedback loops. For instance, the preference for bioproduct use increases the corresponding market demand, which attracts more investment in biorefineries and changes the supply of feedstock. Exogenous variables investigated by the reviewed studies cover the market demand, population growth, GDP change, imposed regulations and incentives to evaluate endogenous factors such as the price of biomass and biofuel, change in land-use pattern, and fuel or energy choices of consumers. Through analyzing the methodological assumptions, we also identified several limitations of the models/frameworks in the existing literature, including (1) the lack of a mechanism to represent the complex interactions within the supply chain of a biorefinery with a diverse product portfolio, and (2) the lack of feedback loops incorporating the environmental (e.g., via life cycle assessment), economic (e.g., via techno-economic analysis), and social (e.g., via social life cycle assessment) influences into the interactions among supply chain components. Accordingly, we proposed a recommendation for methodology development to address these limitations.

AB  - Various types of 'bubbles', e.g. stock market, housing, dot.com, high-tech, historically, are commonly-observed phenomena in complex systems. Yet, their emergence often surprises people who remain unaware of history or their systemic roots. Bubbles are often considered to be simply the product of unwise speculative investments or social mania. Alternatively, conventional economic theories often consider factors, such as interest rates, to be the trigger. However, economic theories rarely account for the systemic structure of markets or for non-linear dynamics. The authors propose that special cases may emerge in some markets to trigger instability. Specifically, when minimal interest rates and capital requirements (down payments) are become extremely low a perceptual shift occurs among consumers such that they become viewed as approximate free goods. This paper proposes that unwise economic policies may activate a free goods scenario initiating a cascading series of destabilizing events leading to market collapse. The authors propose hypothesize that such incendiary policies caused both the 1929 stock market crash and the 2008 subprime housing crisis in the United States. To more deeply examine this claim, these policies were tested using a system dynamics model based on data from both the 1929 and 2008 crises. The model simulated and tested the effects of alternative rate policies on market dynamics. Some of the rates and down payments used in both crises set off tsunami-like shock waves through markets leading to their sudden collapse in these simulations. Based on the findings of this study, found that economic policies lessened market stability. The authors propose several revisions to these policies to foster greater market sustainability.

AB  - Flood risk is a global phenomenon affecting developed and less developed countries alike. Although developed countries are better equipped to handle the consequences of flood events due to investments in disaster risk reduction measures, less developed countries are struggling to cope with this challenge. This can be attributed to the complexities of managing floods while ensuring environmental sustainability, which are yet to be fully understood. As such, developing strategies to manage floods, adapt, and build resilience requires understanding the complex relationships between socioeconomic, environmental, and infrastructural factors to promote policy development in sustainable flood risk management. System archetypes provide a framework for understanding complex system behaviour and assessment of intended and unintended consequences of policy actions. Using the coastal city of Limbe as a case study, this paper identified and analysed four key system archetypes that define flood risk management in Limbe;- 'fixes that fail', 'shifting the burden', 'limits to growth/success' and 'growth and under-investment'. Findings from the study underscore that policy availability does not directly translate to policy implementation and that Limbe's operational policies prioritise quick fixes for flood symptoms, often leading to unintended consequences, emphasizing the need for adaptive, flexible policies. Some leverage points are discussed to improve the sustainable management of floods and advocate for policies that consider long-term sustainability within its urban planning system, considering future urban and population growth to ensure sustainability in the short, medium, and long run.

AB  - Many regular business operations are transforming into digital services, increasing advanced multi-platforms, rapid operational alignment, flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption, hardware waste, and technology investments. Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study's findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile's 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems' environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

AB  - Energy security has become a worldwide issue in recent years. Coal resources security (CRS), an important part of energy security, has been an emerging concern in many countries, due to the diminishing fossil energy reserve and unbalanced energy structure. However, there is no universally agreed method of constructing indicator system for CRS assessment. Subjectivity in the process of evaluation also affects the results of assessment. Moreover, CRS is a complex system that should be evaluated scientifically under diverse methods. Therefore, we constructed an indicator system and evaluation model of CRS and used a case study of China and 31 provinces in its mainland to evaluate CRS at both national and provincial levels. The indicator system included two subsystems-long-term CRS and short-term CRS. We also chose a few elements and factors that are consistent with China's reality. Different research methods were used: the entropy-weight-based TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is applied to evaluate the degree of CRS, which avoids the subjectivity of weight determination and reflects the relative merit of each indicator; the BP (Back-Propagation) Neural Network method is used to analyze the sensitivity of CRS to each index. The results show that the national level of CRS dropped in the early years but slowly picked up with the help of government intervention. Investment in coal industry development resulted in the immediate effect of improving CRS. The positive impact of maintaining environmental sustainability is stable over either the short, medium, or long term. The degrees of CRS vary significantly across provinces, even between those with similar coal stock levels. Extra attention should be paid to the transportation of coal resources among provinces and intervention to balance supply and demand within the regions.

AB  - The ability of private conservation organizations to remain financially viable is a key factor influencing their effectiveness. One-third of financially motivated private-land conservation areas (PLCAs) surveyed in South Africa are unprofitable, raising questions about landowners' abilities to effectively adapt their business models to the socioeconomic environment. In any complex system, options for later adaptation can be constrained by starting conditions (path dependence). We tested 3 hypothesized drivers of path dependence in PLCA ecotourism and hunting business models: (H1) the initial size of a PLCA limits the number of mammalian game and thereby predators that can be sustained; (H2) initial investments in infrastructure limit the ability to introduce predators; and (H3) rainfall limits game and predator abundance. We further assessed how managing for financial stability (optimized game stocking) or ecological sustainability (allowing game to fluctuate with environmental conditions) influenced the ability to overcome path dependence. A mechanistic PLCA model based on simple ecological and financial rules was run for different initial conditions and management strategies, simulating landowner options for adapting their business model annually. Despite attempts by simulated landowners to increase profits, adopted business models after 13 years were differentiated by initial land and infrastructural assets, supporting H1 and H2. A conservation organization's initial assets can cause it to become locked into a financially vulnerable business model. In our 50-year simulation, path dependence was overcome by fewer of the landowners who facilitated natural ecological variability than those who maintained constant hunting rates and predator numbers, but the latter experienced unsustainably high game densities in low rainfall years. Management for natural variability supported long-term ecological sustainability but not shorter term socioeconomic sustainability for PLCAs. Our findings highlight trade-offs between ecological and economic sustainability and suggest a role for governmental support of the private conservation industry.

AB  - This paper explores how climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy pose new systemic financial risks (so-called Green Swans), and the role of central banks in addressing them within their financial stability mandate. It does so by developing a three-layered analytical framework that central banks could use to shape their climate-related monetary and financial policies. First, central banks have already started to revisit their backward-looking risk models for the purpose of integrating forward-looking climate-related risks. Second, given the limitations of existing climate-economy models in a context of radical uncertainty, we argue that future climate scenario analysis should rely on systems-based approaches such as non-equilibrium models and more qualitative tools such as those provided by a socio-technical perspective. However, even these new approaches will not suffice from the perspective of financial stability: climate-related risks will remain largely unhedgeable as long as a system-wide and structural transformation is not undertaken, including an unprecedented level of cooperation between central banks, fiscal authorities, the private and public sectors at large, civil society, and the international community. Third, and as a result of the first two points, embracing climate-related uncertainty means that central banks play a new role: helping to coordinate the policies needed to fight climate change, so as to fulfil their own mandate of financial stability. To this end, we make a few specific policy proposals.
   Key policy insights
   Central banks' traditional risk models do not enable them to identify climate-related systemic risks (Green Swans).
   Adopting new forward-looking and non-equilibrium modelling approaches is necessary to better appreciate the nature of climate-related risks, but it is not sufficient.
   To continue fulfilling their mandate of financial stability over longer time horizons than those traditionally considered, central banks must also get involved in policy coordination to mitigate climate change.
   This includes exploring which policy mixes (fiscal-monetary-prudential) can better address the climate imperatives ahead; considering climate stability as a global public good to be supported through reforms of the international monetary and financial system; and systematizing the integration of long-term sustainability criteria in both private and public sectors.

AB  - Historically, soils have always underpinned civilisation. Their role is fundamental to the provision of food and water, along with a wide range of ecosystem goods and services. Soils are arguably the most complex systems oil Earth, and are intimately linked to human security and the integrity of the wider environment. In this paper we propose 18 ecosystem services that are critical for soils and land use in the UK. Soils are extremely heterogeneous and not all soils can fulfil the full spectrum of services required for the future of the UK, so there is a need to protect their Multifunctional attributes in order to preserve national and international natural capital. There are concerns that anthropogenically induced changes in land use or management will result ill Soils not being utilised to provide the functions to which they are best suited. For example, soils primarily suited for food Supply may be given over to Provide a platform for construction. This is ail all-pervading and recurring concern and highlights the importance of critical decisions, thresholds and potential 'tipping points'. Once critical soil functions are lost they are irrecoverable, potentially for millennia, representing a loss of resource that is fundamental to the UK's national livelihood and well-being. Pressures from changes in climate and to the Earth system will bring about complex and systematic change to soils and their abilities to provide essential functions. We therefore recommend national needs for ensuring the sustainability for soils and future land use in the UK. They are to maintain the long-term base for soil science through education and intellectual investment. including communication of the value of soils and land as natural capital; to manage soil resources so that multifunctionality prevails and critical tipping points are avoided; to audit the national soil resource through soil mapping; preparation of appropriate databases and provision of long-term monitoring networks and observatories; and to synthesise adaptable predictive frameworks for soil system science through integrated modelling.

AB  - Taiwan's encouragement of installing solar photovoltaic power plants (SPPPs) on warehouse rooftops is a step towards sustainability and profitable investment. This study, analyzing the installations of STY Company, found that rooftop SPPPs significantly boost revenue, with rates increasing from 2.0088% to 6.8681% over 20 years. The break-even point is in the 7th year, with a return rate ranging from 2.0088 to 2.1748%. This shows that SPPP investments are a benefit for investors, shortening construction times and allowing warehouses to sell solar energy at an earlier date. This research utilized a fuzzy nonlinear multi-objective programming model to examine trade-offs between construction time, cost, quality, and revenue (TCQR) to optimize SPPP construction. The findings suggest that reducing construction time is an effective strategy to lower carbon emissions despite potential cost increases. However, time and quality costs are inversely proportional, highlighting the importance of efficient project management in minimizing the impacts of this trade-off. Adjusting funding can maintain quality while speeding up construction. Completing projects early also heightens revenue from green energy sales, offsetting higher initial investments. The TCQR focuses on investment revenue, managing time efficiently, and making data-driven decisions to expedite SPPP development. This model improves project profitability and promotes sustainable growth by reducing construction time and optimizing financial strategies. This study's contribution includes: 1. Optimizing the installation process of warehouse rooftop SPPPs, which provide significant long-term revenue and environmental benefits. 2. Combining the different research methods of scholars into fuzzy methods that can solve complex systems with high uncertainty. The nonlinear model put forth by this study is closer to the actual situation and can handle balancing complex problems in multi-objective programming. 3. Improving the efficiency of time management to make it feasible to reduce construction time to lower carbon emissions. 4. Concocting a comprehensive approach integrating financial, environmental, and operational factors for successful SPPP development. This study addresses an academic gap. Previously, scholars conducted research independently, focusing solely on financial investment or time, cost, and quality (TCQ) issues without considering the two together. By combining financial investment with TCQ, this study fills a significant gap in academic research. According to this study, better investment returns could improve the promotion of solar energy. Unlike previous research, this study integrates the analysis of TCQ with that of revenue by assessing costs and revenues together. This approach allows decision-makers to derive judgments from the TCQR model quickly.

AB  - Waste management in low-income countries faces challenges with an average cost of $35/ton approximately 51% collection efficiency. Despite investments in treatment, processing, and recycling, the system remains unsustainable owing to poor planning and policies. The current analysis of Lahore's solid waste management (SWM) system, selected as a major city of a low-income country as a case study, focuses on collection efficiency and waste generation. However, it neglects the complex and dynamic nature of SWM systems. To capture the complexities and dynamic nature of the SWM system, system dynamic (SD) modeling is proposed for its effectiveness in modeling complex and dynamic systems. Unlike previous attempts at SD modeling that mostly consider only some components of the SWM system with varying success, this study attempts to use a holistic approach by considering all aspects of an integrated SWM system. In addition, this study explores different financial and management policies, highlighting the weaknesses of the system through a quantitative comparison of three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU) which considers the current trends in waste generation and practices of collection and disposal to landfill, (2) waste treatment system (WTS) in which various waste treatment systems are included to reduce burden on landfill, and (3) introduction of user fee with awareness campaigns (UFAC) which encourages community participation towards reduction in waste generation and financially supports the SWM. All three scenarios use four indices: waste generation, waste ending up in landfill, uncollected waste, and annual budget deficit as performance indices. These scenarios were simulated over a 25-year period using an SD model, covering all six components of the SWM system. The BAU scenario shows a 16% increase in waste generation, a 173% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 64% increase in the budget deficit over the simulation period, indicating an unsustainable SWM system. The WTS scenario exhibits a 16% increase in waste generation, a 155% increase in landfill waste, an 11% reduction in uncollected waste, and a 61% increase in the budget deficit, showing a significant reduction in landfill waste and a slight reduction in deficit but it remains unsustainable. The UFAC scenario, however, results in a 40% reduction in waste generation, a 67% decrease in uncollected waste, an 8% decrease in landfill waste, and a 59% decrease in the budget deficit. These results demonstrate that instituting user fees for SWM services and incentivizing community participation towards waste reduction and segregation can make the SWM system of Lahore sustainable. This SD model provides insights for policymakers, aiding what-if analyses and long/short-term waste management plans for metropolitan cities in low-income countries. To validate the sustainability judgments based on performance indices, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool commonly used for ranking policy decisions based on competing criteria, was employed. It considered the same four criteria as in the SD model. The results of the AHP analysis aligned with those of the SD model, ranking the UFAC scenario as the most sustainable option.

AB  - Based on sustainable development theory and the method of system dynamics and multi-agent simulation, the environment-economy-society relationship model of Liaohe River Basin is constructed by coupling the system dynamics model with the multi-agent model in the software-NetLogo. This paper selects the Qinghe, Fanhe and Puhe River of Liaohe River Basin which are located in Shenyang and Tieling City as the study boundary, then the overall situation of environment, economy and society development is analyzed. At the same time, in order to simulate and predict the overall operation of the model under different policies, three kinds of development scenarios are established by changing some key variables including pollution abatement investment, fixed assets investment and industrial waste water production of ten thousand yuan industrial output value. The results show that the development under different policies can be simulated and predicted by this model, which will provide support for macroeconomic regulation and control the sustainable development strategy of Liaohe River Basin.

AB  - The human consumption behavior is the main parameter for the environmental pollution. Especially now in today's globalized world, using fast moving consumer goods has become more widespread, eventually resulting in a significant increase in the waste generation. This increase is ominously caused by the packaging wastes especially with its implicit economic value.
   The materials used in packaging industry are plastics, metal, glass, paper, wood and composites. The food and beverage packaging, which commonly uses plastic, metal, glass and composite materials has a market share amounting to approximately 70% in the overall packaging sector [1]. In 2018, 1,167.5 billion liters of packaged beverages were consumed worldwide [2].
   With the above in mind, the packaging waste also has a detrimental impact to the pollution of the ecosystem unless they are not managed properly. Many countries try to solve this problem by collecting beverage packaging before they get mixed with other wastes and send the beverage packaging to recycling facilities. In Europe, 74% of glass, 80% of metal and 42% of plastic was recycled in 2016 and 2017 [1] [3]. However, these percentages are not enough to prevent pollution and ensure sustainability. According to Lebreton et al., each year 1.15 to 2.41 million tons of plastic waste streams from rivers to oceans [4].
   There are several experimented options to solve this problem without causing a loss in the value of the relevant packaging material. In order to reproduce a packaging material, in the exact same form and quality with the materials produced from the raw material, the quality and status of the used material becomes rather important. Therefore, a specific method, among others, becomes prominent for the recollection of the used beverage packaging, before these become wasted and contaminated. This system is called "Deposit Refund System (DRS)". In the DRS, each beverage packaging shall have a certain deposit value and with each purchase the consumer shall pay that deposit value in addition to the product price.
   After the consumption of the beverage, the consumer returns the empty packaging and the deposit value is refunded to the consumer. This system leads the way to clean and effective collection of recyclable beverage packaging. Around the world, 45 countries are currently using the DRS and in average 88% of their beverage packaging are recycled via this system [5].
   The DRS is a very complex system that concerns too many stakeholders. The success of the system depends on a clear structuring and outlining of the relationships, duties, authorities and responsibilities of each partaker. Accordingly, the legal framework shall set forth a comprehensive framework, in order to regulate all procedures and principles relating to the DRS.
   The main outcome of the study will be to determine the advantages of implementing the DRS in Turkey, for beverage packaging waste management. In addition, we will also analyze the governance models of DRS, where the DRS is run by an Operator. In most of the countries, this operator is generally a non-profit organization, established by beverage producers and retailers. In this study, we will also examine the alternative governance models, such as state owned and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models. We have also focused on the PPP model, as an innovative and efficient tool and a suitable model for the performance of DRS system. We will further elaborate on the financial sustainability of the PPP projects and how to create "bankable projects". As an innovative model for the DRS, we created a well-structured finance model with resilience revenue stream in the PPP option for long-term public services. Accordingly, these should be taken into consideration during the establishment and the implementation of the DRS design.
   The DRS comprises of several operational steps, which are the collection of empty containers from consumers through reverse vending machines (RVMs) or manual return points, the transfer to scoring and bailing facilities. The DRS Operator shall be responsible for these operational processes. The countries who apply the DRS are relatively smaller than Turkey, by surface area and population. This difference creates a need for designing a DRS, based specifically on Turkey's needs and properties. For this purpose, relevant studies, sectoral and governmental reports about the DRS and Turkish packaging waste management system was researched and suggestions based on technical structure, governance model and legal background will be given as an output of the study. On the other hand, a very well-designed database operating software is necessary to measure all processes in the system and to combat counterfeiting and fraud.
   Another impressive impact of the DRS is that it is the proper and easiest way to adopt circular economy concept for communities, industries, and governments. Since one of the main purposes of circular economy is usage of waste material (such as packaging waste) as a raw material in different production fields, the implementation of the DRS would achieve this aim by definition. Segregated collection of wastes becomes a very important issue for the reproduction of new products from recycled materials. Such collection method is also significantly important for resource preservation, which is another crucial matter in circular economy. For an effective production process, the packaging waste is required to be clean and without any contamination. The DRS is one of the best implementation mechanisms for separate collection of packaging waste. European Commission has been working on circular economy and they submitted the New Circular Economy Action Plan in March 2020 [6]. This new plan aims to design entire life cycle of products while promoting circular economy processes, fostering sustainable consumption and aiming to keep resources available as much as possible in EU's economy.
   Lastly, we will also be considering and examining other environmental benefits of the DRS in Turkey.

AB  - Civil infrastructure systems transform over the long-term due to complex interactions among socio-environmental stressors, degradation of physical networks, and decision-making processes of infrastructure agencies. To incorporate such complex transformation mechanisms into infrastructure cost management, this study integrates simulation modeling and life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to create a framework for dynamic network-level LCCA in infrastructure systems. The proposed framework was implemented using a multi-agent simulation model in a numerical case study related to a road network affected by sea-level rise, population growth, and uncertain maintenance funding. The results include identification of several state transition, and tipping point behaviors at which small changes in service demand, maintenance budget, and adaptation investment may result in significant improvement in network cost and performance conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework in modeling the long-term trajectories of life-cycle costs at the network level under different stressors and decision scenarios.

AB  - Sustainability of infrastructure systems involves multiple interrelated objectives which are dependent on the dynamic behaviors of stakeholders, interdependencies between infrastructure assets, and evolving conditions in the social and environmental systems. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a framework that integrates: (1) different dimensions of sustainability in infrastructure networks, and (2) dynamic changes in the behaviors of stakeholders, asset performance conditions, and the social and environmental conditions. The proposed framework includes an agent based simulation model to capture the dynamic behaviors of decision makers and the evolving performance of infrastructure assets under different socio-environmental conditions. The outcomes of the simulation model include the short-and long-term costs and environmental impacts of infrastructure networks under different scenarios related to the changes in the socio-environmental conditions. The application of the framework is shown in a numerical case study of a road network. The results include: (i) identification of infrastructure management strategies (e.g., maintenance planning and funding allocation) that optimize the tradeoff between annual cost and environmental impacts of the network; and (ii) discovering robust management strategies that lead to highly-likely desired sustainability outcomes across different uncertain scenarios related to the future socio-environmental conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework for sustainability assessment of infrastructure systems based on integrated analysis of the dynamic behaviors of decision-makers, infrastructure characteristics, and evolving socio-environmental conditions. Hence, it provides a predictive quantitative tool to inform decision-making and policy formulation toward improving the sustainability of infrastructure networks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Recent requirements for sustainable development and increasing trend for public-private partnerships (PPPs) have added additional complexities to the policy-making process in the infrastructure management domain. To support policy analysis, this paper presents a system dynamics (SD) model to analyse the impact of different strategic policies (e.g. budgeting, PPP involvement) on infrastructure serviceability, backlog accumulation and sustainability. The proposed model has been implemented on a network of school buildings from the Toronto District School Board asset inventory. Four sets of experiments with different policy scenarios over a 50-year strategic planning horizon have been conducted to investigate policies related to rehabilitation, budget distribution, government investment and PPP involvement. The proposed model was implemented on a commercial SD software incorporating all the dynamic interactions among the strategic parameters. The experiment results show that the model works as a practical decision support tool that enables asset managers to test the effectiveness of various strategic policy scenarios on long-term infrastructure performance.

AB  - The Smart city is important for sustainability. Governments engaged in developing urban mobility in the smart city need to invest their limited financial resources wisely to realize sustainability goals. A key area for such sustainability investment is how to implement and invest in emerging technologies for urban mobility solutions. However, current frameworks on how to understand the impact of emerging technologies aligned with long-term sustainability strategies are understudied. This article develops a simulation-based comparison between different cities and autonomous vehicle (AV) adoption scenarios to understand which aspects of cities lead to positive AV implementation outcomes. As urban mobility and cities will become smart, the analysis represents a first attempt to explore the impact of AVs on a large scale across different cities around the world. Archetypes are formed and account for most, if not all, world cities. For three of our archetypes (car-centric giants, prosperous innovation centers, and high-density megacities), promoting AV-shuttle use would deliver the greatest advantage as measured by improvements in the model's KPIs. To develop urban powerhouses, however, micromobility would deliver greater benefits. For highly compact middleweights, a shift from private cars to other non-AV modes of transportation would be the smartest choice.

AB  - Food processing industries confront challenges in dealing with wastewater due to seasonal fluctuations. This can lead to potentially untreated wastewater discharge and regulatory non-compliance. Untreated water can also adversely affect the efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment and the local environment. A mobile rental wastewater treatment service for the food processing industry has been proposed as an innovative solution, simultaneously promoting the Circular Economy through water reuse and material recovery. It enables on- demand and on-site wastewater processing, particularly during peak operation. Moreover, it provides additional services for extracting value-added compounds (e.g., polyphenols), delivering further financial benefits. To assess the sustainability of this new business model, this paper presents a hybrid simulation study using agent- based, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis. The hybrid model is applied to a new mobile wastewater service being trialled in the Peloponnesian region of Greece. By considering factors such as customer composition and the volume of wastewater to be treated, logistics (mobile units and hubs), and staggered investments in capacity boosting, the model supports the commercialisation efforts of the rental business model put forward in the case study. The paper contributes to modelling methodology, especially in the use of hybrid simulation within the context of the circular economy of water; it also contributes to the practice of modelling and simulation by exploring their role in assessing the feasibility of novel business models.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to understand the impact of financial key performance indicators (KPIs) namely customer accounts receivable flow time and credit limit allowed by financial partners-on the financial sustainability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) during business growth trajectories from an operations management perspective. This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs.
