AB  - Processes in inter-organizational projects tend to be complex to coordinate. Within these projects, stakeholders have to make decisions together, despite a limited awareness of the other parties’ interests and views. Frequently, coordination in inter-organizational projects is ineffective and inadequately addressed, despite the investment of considerable effort, which often results in delays and/or unwanted project outcomes. The purpose of this study is to investigate how a shared problem understanding for inter-organizational decision making can be achieved by means of sustainable coordination. In this study, CIMO logic was used to explore the context of the organizational change, followed by the application of design science research in order to develop an intervision process. The findings of this study are twofold. To manage the complex problem context, additional efforts were needed in order to create awareness of the team’s coordination activities. The application of the concept of co-designing resulted in a higher degree of sustainable relational coordination. The resulting intervision process aided the team in gaining a shared problem understanding of the decision making process in the inter-organizational project. The use of the co-designed intervision process can potentially be employed for other complex systematic problems, such as those occurring in the construction industry. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) is a popular topic for governments and businesses around the world; yet, only a few comprehensive and economy-wide frameworks exist, and the consequences of the CE on economic systems stay unclear. With this systematic review, we put under scrutiny the existing contributions to Circular Economy (CE) that apply the Agent-based modelling methodology. There is an open gap in the CE literature regarding the use of ABM. The research question that guides this systematic review concerns the potential benefit of ABM for CE and how to use this methodology in the context of CE. We put in evidence three thematic areas, two agents and one process, namely producers, i.e. firms and industrial systems, consumers, i.e. households and waste disposal, and the diffusion of innovation. We infer that the former three thematic strands of literature can be further synthetized together to form a general model of the Circular Economy. This development is crucial to properly evaluate how the agent's heterogeneity affects the diffusion and the consequences of the adoption of CE practices on the economy. Research has widely applied ABM simulations to consider the impact of heterogeneity amongst individuals and their behavioural interactions on the evolution of complex systems, yet very little did it systematically about CE. Our results complement those of Computable General Equilibrium models. The review provides an interpretative framework, suggests valuable future research directions within the new comprehensive thematic area, and contributes to the theoretical and managerial discussion on agent-based modelling in the circular economy. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The authors of this book assert that Grid Square statistics, a method of aggregating data within a geographically defined Grid, may be an effective solution to approach geospatial data for big data integration. Grid Square statistics is a technique that allows us to collect and analyze data based on Grids and makes it easier to understand patterns and trends. Sustainability, a key concern for the future of our society, often involves balancing multiple independent objectives. These objectives and key performance indicators must be shared to solve multi-dimensional optimization problems with some constraints related to sustainability issues. However, many of these sustainability issues are challenges that are part of global systems, which are modeled as a complex system consisting of many components. Social, economic, and environmental aspects in our socio-economic systems require solutions designed for the sustainability of our society. These conditions imply that Big Data must contribute to evaluating our current situation, actions, and changes to continuously change our behavior and society based on a Plan-Do-Check-Action (PDCA) cycle. The PDCA cycle, also known as the Deming cycle, is a four-step management method used to improve processes and products continuously. We must understand how to construct a platform by using Big Data to do so. Thus, extracting meaningful information from Big Data is crucially important in the advanced information society.This book provides case studies based on Grid Square statistics. It shows their applications to socio-economic and environmental problems such as tourism, where we analyze visitor patterns to optimize resource allocation, SDGs indicator, where we monitor the sustainability of our socio-economic systems, and disaster management, where we face natural disaster to enhance preparedness. Finally, the book proposes a World Grid Square Statistics Reference Architecture for constructing data applications across organizations and domains and reports on design concepts, system architecture, and the implication of a data platform for World Grid Square data and statistics. ©The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Educators of sustainability can easily point out the non-linear complexities of human impact on the climate but have difficulty pinpointing the impact of daily personal activities and consumption choices. Current sustainability strategies struggle to recognize and account for the interconnectedness of our socio-environmental-economic systems and subsystems. Much like how Theseus in Greek Mythology used a red thread to navigate the labyrinth to slay the Minotaur, we introduce a methodology of Tracing the Red Threads to teach how mitigating actions taken in one system will impact and ripple through adjacent systems. Students learn how to analyze complex systems in an approachable manner and understand the relationships among seemingly disparate system components. A former student adapted the method to create a rubric to evaluate personal consumption choices that thread between two UN SDGs. © Mark Starik and Patricia Kanashiro 2021.

AB  - This study presents a proof-of-concept focusing on sustainable crowdfunding models for renewables as alternatives to conventional financing instruments and proposes a Philanthropic-Crowdfunding-Partnership (PCP) model. In this regard, this research investigates social welfare by evaluating the change in wealth inequality for the future time horizon by simulating conventional and the PCP financing models on solar farms in the case study of Turkey. The motivation is to find a solution for financing regional development in a holistic approach considering society and the environment to accomplish sustainable development. Furthermore, it also aims to provide insights into innovative public-private partnerships to unlock new horizons for development by incorporating citizen participation at large. The PCP model's objective is to mobilize capital throughout the public by prioritizing individuals along with small and medium enterprises over the large corporates in fundraising for renewable energy projects, mainly solar farms. This paper provides quantitative evidence that the PCP functions as a sustainable and alternative financing model by dramatically reducing wealth inequality. Besides, the PCP holds the potential to become a self-sufficient financing mechanism for projects ranging from small ones to mega initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Averting Climate Catastrophe Together addresses the necessity of meeting the Paris Agreement temperature target and explores what framework could enable climate action in an effective, efficient and equitable manner that is consistent with that goal. It also looks at the contribution of technological change within the economic system, including the feasibility of a global energy transition. Whether humanity can avoid catastrophic climate change does not seem to depend on the availability of technological solutions, but rather on international cooperation and coordination. Given the various sustainability issues, this book also considers if it is possible to derive a general approach to them. It argues that dealing with compatibility limits in complex systems requires a holistic change in the system structure. Therefore, systems science is discussed together with economics, technological change, and sustainable development. This book targets scientists and experts from different disciplines due to the interdisciplinary topic, but especially from environmental economics and energy technology; policy makers, as policy recommendations are provided to address climate change; as well as the general public due to the pressing common challenge of climate change and comprehensive efforts for sustainable development. Provides evidence based on climate science research on the necessity of meeting the Paris Agreement temperature target Highlights the feasibility of the global energy transition as one major option to mitigate climate change, also going into detail about the process of technological change Brings together systems science with economics, technological change, and sustainable development Derives a framework to meet the Paris Agreement temperature target, enabling coordinated climate action in an effective and efficient manner while pursuing distributive justice. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Balancing the relationship between population and environment is crucial for urban sustainability nowadays. Research on the coordinated development of population and environment from the perspective of city size is relatively scarce. This study constructed a comprehensive evaluation system for demographic and environmental systems. It applied a relative development index, a modified coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, an obstacle degree model, and a two-way fixed effects model to explore the development trends, coupling coordination relationships and influencing factors of the Population-Environment (P-E) complex system in 35 metropolitan cities in China from 2006 to 2022. The results indicated that (1) the development levels of population and environment had generally improved, and there were significant disparities in the population development level among cities of different sizes; (2) population development lagged behind environmental development, though they became gradually synchronized; (3) the CCD of P-E complex system increased with city sizes; (4) major factors influencing P-E coordination included population reproduction, environmental investments, aging and migration. Larger-scale cities like megacities should prioritize to mitigate population aging, narrow urban-rural income gap, strengthen pollution control, and balance gender structure. Smaller-scale cities can focus on optimizing industrial and employment structures. These findings provided suggestions to promote urban coordinated, high-quality and sustainable development. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urban infrastructures, to fully take advantage of future investments, must first be recognized as interconnected complex systems of systems. This forum paper describes research and education needs that, if properly addressed, could prepare the civil engineering profession to meet the new challenges of urban infrastructure renovation. Among the needs, the objective documentation of the life-cycle performance of constructed systems could leverage novel sensing systems and advances in computer science, tools often untapped by civil engineering programs. Other needs and opportunities involve the design process, perhaps the most important milestone in the development of civil engineers. The topics and needs discussed in this paper could becomecore curriculum areas in newly developed postgraduate and eventually in undergraduate programs. The authors hypothesize that, if the integration of such topics is successful, civil engineers could become true protagonists of the rejuvenation of the US urban infrastructures and future stewards of cities and megacities. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Switzerland is considering implementing a strategic energy reserve, a novel policy instrument that remunerates power plant operators for storing a minimum amount of energy in reservoirs to convert into electricity when called upon. The policy is envisioned for the winter period, when the country’s large hydropower reservoirs tend to be nearly depleted. This study analyzes the impact of such a strategic energy reserve on security of supply, consumer costs, international trade, and sustainability. A hybrid simulation model is developed that combines agent-based modeling and system dynamics. The simulations show that the reserve can improve short-term security of supply but does not improve long-term security of supply as it does not impact domestic investments or reduce the import dependency in winter. The reserve leads to a slight increase in consumer costs, even when including the reduction in outage costs. A larger reserve is more effective at reducing the supply risk but is proportionally costly. Lastly, we find that the policy induces scarcity periods that would not have occurred otherwise, which means that the reserve should have a high strike price to ensure it is only called upon as a last resort. We conclude that there is no structural need for a strategic energy reserve, as it only increases short-term security of supply and does not contribute to solving the structural problem. Any implementation should be done on an ad hoc basis, conditional on a short-term generation adequacy assessment. This has the potential to minimize the associated costs while maximizing the benefits. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The sustainability of the ongoing Campaign-Based Watershed Management (CBWM) program in Ethiopia is questionable due to poor planning and implementation of the Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) structures. This study uses an empirically based, agent-based model to explore the effect of six scenarios on both area of land covered by, as well as the quality of SWC structures in three Kebeles (villages) of Boset District. The analysis revealed that integrating multiple interventions enhanced SWC most in all Kebeles. Furthermore, increasing the commitment of local government through capacity building generated most effect and yet required the lowest investment. Motivating farmers, introducing alternative livelihood opportunities and establishing and strengthening micro-watershed associations had limited, but differential influence on the outcomes across the Kebeles. However, all alternative scenarios had some added value compared to doing business as usual. Hence, in order to enhance the outcomes and sustainability of the ongoing CBWM program in the study area and other similar localities, it is crucial to pay much more attention to increasing the commitment of local government actors through capacity building. This empowers local government actors to (1) plan and more efficiently imple-ment the program in consultation with other local actors, and (2) integrate locally sensitive need-based adaptation of the program. © 2021, University of Surrey.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic challenges the sustainability of the modern financial system. International central bankers claim that banks are solid. They have accumulated significant capital buffers. Those buffers should be further more augmented by 2027 in line with Basel III reforms. However, disregarding such a consecutive rise in the banking capital adequacy requirements, the US financial authorities undertook an unprecedented step. First time in the country history they lowered the reserve requirement to zero at the end of March 2020. Friedrich von Hayek demonstrated the fragility of the modern fractional reserve banking systems. Together with Ludwig von Mises (von Mises, 1978) he was thus able to predict the Great Depression of 1929 and explain its mechanics much in advance. Thus, we wish to utilize the agent-based modeling technique to extend von Hayek's rationale to the previously unstudied interaction of capital adequacy and reserve requirement regulation. We find that the full reserve requirement regime even without capital adequacy regulation provides more stable financial environment than the existing one. Rise in capital adequacy adds to modern banking sustainability, but it still preserves the system remarkably fragile compared to the full reserve requirement. We also prove that capital adequacy regulation is redundant when the latter environment is in place. We discuss our findings application to the potential Central Bank Digital Currencies regulation.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Green finance development, which enhances innovation capacity and economic green transformation, helps people deal with the challenges of climate change, ecological crisis and energy security. It is important to achieve sustainable and balanced development for green finance. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is built with four participants, which include governments, financial institutions, enterprises, and consumers. Analogue simulation is applied to analyze the influences of each parameter on changes and development in green financial market. Equilibrium strategy and influence mechanism of participating entities are investigated. The result shows that: first, the integrity of the green financial system has a positive impact on sustainability developments and cleaner production. Second, it is critical to strengthen the government regulation, slash financial institutions and enterprises’ green finance production cost, increase the compensation for consumer pollution, and reduce the supervision cost of government. Accordingly, to integrity green financial system, governments, financial institutions, enterprises, and consumers needs participation and cooperation among each other. © 2020

AB  - During the 1992 Rio Conference, the sustainable development agenda envisioned a transformative change for the management of natural resources, where the well-being of human society would be enhanced through the sustainable use of natural capital. Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social–ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social–ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social–ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Various methods are used when building bankruptcy prediction models. New sophisticated methods that are already used in other scientific fields can also be applied in this area. Graph theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing and visualizing complex systems, making it a valuable tool for assessing the sustainability and financial health of businesses. The motivation for the research was the interest in the application of this method rarely applied in predicting the bankruptcy of companies. The paper aims to propose an improved dynamic bankruptcy prediction model based on graph theoretical modelling. The dynamic model considering the causality relation between financial features was built for the period 2015–2021. Financial features entering the model were selected with the use of Domain knowledge approach. When building the model, the weights of partial permanents were proposed to determine their impact on the final permanent and the algorithm for the optimalisation of these weights was established to obtain the best performing model. The outcome of the paper is the improved dynamic graph theoretical model with a good classification accuracy. The developed model is applicable in the field of bankruptcy prediction and is an equivalent sophisticated alternative to already established models. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This research delves into sustainability within the road freight transport sector, focusing on how financing policies interact with the capital structures of haulage companies. Employing an agent-based model inspired by Sweden's freight sector, we simulate strategies for fleet replacement while considering financial health and balance sheets. Hauliers are portrayed as agents with financial attributes sourced from real-world financial statements. Their financing decisions are informed by pecking order theory. Through a series of scenario tests, we simulate the impacts of policy interventions on hauliers’ transition trajectories. Our findings highlight the challenges associated with integrating electric trucks, attributed to limited financing avenues. Both internal and equity financing are found to be inadequate, while debt financing raises concerns about credit risks. These findings remain robust even when incentives like subsidies and reduced interest rates on loans are introduced. The study underscores the intricate interplay between financial factors and sustainable heavy-duty road transport. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Sustainability of local co-operative taxi networks in the face of competition from corporate behemoths is a problem worthy of investigation. Lack of infrastructure background support and venture capital demands alternative strategies for survival. A viable solution requires novel modeling approach and computational framework. Such framework needs to be fully distributed and therefore is sub-optimal. We propose an intra-city taxi service that leverages individual rides and local network for ride management. This, in turn, demands a bunch of decision variables and objectives to be optimized. Some of these objectives are conflicting and therefore the problem requires a multi objective optimization formulation. We propose to exploit the flexible structure and multi-agent like behavior of Ant colony optimization to tackle the diversity of objectives in the ride share problem. We consider the scenario of ride share only since that is the hardest part in the taxi business. The implementation is multi-modular and provides an alternative approach to commonly used centralized taxi network. We define novel performance metrics and present results to supplement the modeling approach. Our results show that spatio-temporal diversity is the biggest road block to wide scale ride sharing. Nonetheless, our solution ensures up to 77% acceptance in shared rides. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The government of Indonesia (GOI) has committed to accelerating electric motorcycles adoption for reducing transport sector emissions. A battery swapping scheme is an attractive option for the GOI to solve several impediments to electric motorcycle adoption related to short milage, charging times, and initial investment costs. However, the battery swapping policy alone seems ineffective in supporting emission reduction targets since Indonesia's grid electricity source is still dominated by fossil energy. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce a green battery swapping concept. It is a concept that integrates the battery swapping scheme with the use of solar energy as its primary energy source for the battery. However, creating a sustainable green battery swapping industry should be assessed as a complex system. Hence, a holistic view is needed to understand the system process and determine the relationship between related elements. This study aims to develop the conceptual model of a sustainable green battery swapping business development using system dynamics modeling. The conceptual model translated into a system diagram and a causal loop diagram (CLD) provides initial information that solar PV capacity, carbon credit, and incentives for charging stations are the main variables impacting the sustainability of a green battery swapping industry. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to draw attention to an urgent need for reform of the regulatory framework of the broader export credit system to ensure a new and comprehensive “safe haven” for officially supported export credits. The purpose is to analyse the complex debate on disciplines of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), creating a point of reference for future analysis of and debates around the “carve-out clause” of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) and a “safe haven” in a broader sense. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes inspiration from legal, economic and political science literature on subsidies and officially supported export credits, as well as on legal documents related to the WTO and the OECD. It examines the WTO subsidy and the OECD export credits framework, focusing on main legal and economic governance aspects. Then, it gives a critical analysis how “safe” a “safe haven” in a broader sense might be, assessing frictions of and solutions for the fundamentally different set of disciplines, limitations, financial instruments not covered by OECD regulations, as well as new challenges related to climate finance. Findings: After assessing the challenges regarding the “carve-out clause” of the WTO subsidy framework and two tracks aiming to create a new “safe haven”, requirements for comprehensive disciplines for officially supported export credits are pointed out. Furthermore, several misunderstandings and mistakes appearing in the debate are clarified. Research limitations/implications: Desktop research rather than empirical field work. Practical implications: This paper creates awareness for governments and exporters how to deal with a complex system of interrelated disciplines. The question, how “safe” a “safe haven” in a broader sense can be, has not been resolved yet. Some authors focus on the WTO disciplines not taking into account the need for an effective matching procedure of the Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits (the Arrangement). Furthermore, the introduction of several new pre-export financing programmes and the growing significance of climate finance-related instruments for export credit agencies creates both opportunities and challenges. This paper can serve as a reference point for the academic debate and further research. This paper also offers newcomers to the topic a comprehensive overview. Originality/value: Although the “carve-out clause” and the Arrangement have been much discussed, there is limited literature review structuring both existing and new aspects of the debate, assessing (dis)advantages of arguments and interpretations. This paper both adds to the corpus of literature about the ASCM, as well as the Arrangement, and takes this corpus as the object of its analysis. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The economy as a whole and most of its constituent parts, like markets, government institutions, firms, or households, are inherently complex conceptual constructions. Micro-level diversity, decentralized interaction, self-organization, adaptation and learning, emergence, and evolution, are some of the fundamental features that the above entities share and that allow to classify them as being complex entities. In a complex economic system, existing structures of interaction are in constant mutation as individual agents contact and influence one another and, by doing so, reshape the macro environment in which socio-economic relations unfold. Notwithstanding the observed pervasiveness of complexity in economics, there are a few areas of economic thought where the discussion on the theme has gained an exceptional relevance. In this article, six of such areas are identified and their complex nature is highlighted and scrutinized. These pertain to: (i) Knowledge interactions and technological innovation; (ii) Corporate design and organizational learning; (iii) Public policies directed at market regulation; (iv) Banking and financial markets; (v) Environmental economics, sustainability, and climate change; and (vi) income inequality. © 2020, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Irrigation systems contribute worldwide to the provision of a wide range of services on which the survival and well-being of humanity depend. They are of primary importance in Vietnam where about 90% of the water used is for irrigation and aquaculture and where agriculture is the largest employer and a major contributor to the national GDP and to the income of the low-salary households. Nevertheless, irrigation systems have recently been subjected to several issues including increasing demand, pollution, under-investment, depletion of resources or environmental changes. Any mitigation measure against these issues needs to be sustainable with respect to the very diverse uses of the water, the changing conditions upstream and downstream, and the somewhat conflicting objectives carried out by land-use/agricultural planning on one hand and urbanization and society well-being on the other. This need of sustainability requires the design of innovative tools to tackle these issues. This work aims at exploring the usage of Agent-Based Modelling coupled with a tangible and interactive interface in order to enhance interactions between stakeholders and support the evaluation of various alternatives of the management of the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This work presents an application of the modern portfolio theory (MPT). The United Nations 2030 Agenda of sustainable development goals establishes 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) and 169 targets each associated with indicators, integrating the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. This constitutes a complex system to be used by more than 150 countries having different priorities and levels of development. Concerning the 2030 Agenda Goals, MPT can help to define strategies to handle resource allocation problems. In economics, MPT appraises that when choosing a portfolio of assets looking for returns, some investors prefer fewer risks; others accept higher risks. To optimize the countries’ path to sustainability, the decision makers may distribute their resources, acting similarly to an investor. In this case, an SDG corresponds to a portfolio and the assets to the indicators associated with a given Goal. Constructing an efficient frontier of optimal portfolios of assets, MPT provides a method to obtain the maximum possible expected returns for a given level of risk and, besides, the risks and expected returns involved in a weighting choice. The present work restricts the analyses to the indicators of Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), related to energy sustainability, for the five BRICS countries. This choice leads to an ensemble of situations that highlights the applicability of MPT to sustainability. Calculations are presented in detail for Brazil, and a general discussion is presented for the BRICS. The present approach considers the main features of a multi-criteria decision-making method, except the ranking of options by the decision makers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - There is urgency for electrifying fleet vehicles as a means to reach net-zero emissions and promote sustainability, including at maritime container ports. Ports are exploring the incorporation of electric terminal tractors and supporting infras-tructure in an effort to minimize the environmental effects of their operations while simultaneously improving service performance. The challenges include planning of investments in infrastructure that will meet charging requirements of these terminal tractors while maintaining operational efficiencies. This paper develops an optimization and associated risk register for strategic capacity expansion of electric vehicle fleets at maritime container ports. The approach includes multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and a characterization of enterprise risk as a disruption of system order. A demonstration of schedule optimization uses linear program-ming models for thirty-two combinations of plug-in, wireless, and wireless dynamic charging infrastructure configurations to determine optimal charger locations. In a robust ensemble model, the optimization accompanies a comprehensive risk analysis that disrupts importance orders across seven scenarios: (1) Environ-mental Change, (2) Policy Revision, (3) Technology Innovation, (4) Cyber Attack, (5) Market Shift, (6) Electrical Grid Stress, and (7) Workforce Interruption. The results support the decisions and enterprise risk management for a 1.5 billion strategic plan for port infrastructure. The plan involves selecting charging station locations, determining charging schedules, and selecting charger models while considering multiple performance criteria such as safety, operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. The approach is generally applicable for a variety of complex systems to mitigate schedule and cost risks while improving sustainability. The audience of the paper includes owners and operators of transportation and energy infrastructures, asset managers, logistics service providers, and others. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Water scarcity invariably poses a threat to the sustainability of cities and rural areas with limited resources, especially in developing countries. This paper presents a new hydro-economic model based on system dynamics and agent-based simulation to enhance the sustainability of urban groundwater. Dynamic pricing was performed based on several parameters, such as resource conditions, price elasticity, consumption history and climate change, to improve the sustainability of groundwater and cover the costs of implementing strategies. Different scenarios based on pricing, rationing, culturalizing, and non-revenue water control strategies were applied in the village of Dehno in Yazd Province as the case study with an arid climate. The results showed that several scenarios can achieve the goal, but, in drought conditions, only a combination of all the strategies will work. © 2021

AB  - One of the greatest challenges facing humanity is to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. In addition to public and state financial resources, policymakers leverage private companies to promote sustainable growth through green investments and innovations, encouraging private initiatives and financial activities. In this context, SMEs play a crucial role not only at the European level but also as economic actors implementing and pursuing policy goals. This book focuses on the capital and financial aspects of SME activities for sustainable and inclusive growth, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art. Starting from a business economics perspective, the book discusses financial instruments for both the short and long term. Supply Chain Finance (SCF) offers a theoretical framework for short-term instruments, improving overall supply chain sustainability through companies’ choices of suppliers, buyers, customers, financial institutions, and technology providers. Innovations such as FinTechs and Blockchain can enhance the effectiveness of sustainable business and bring about substantial changes in relationships among different actors. With regard to long-term instruments like debt capital, the book analyzes the traditional banking channel along with the role of the financial market. Factors such as the impact of FinTechs and other innovations on market efficiency have the potential to change financing activities, making relationships more complex and binding. In this complex system, new laws and regulations can mean sudden changes in terms of providing loans. The banking sector is increasingly using CSR drivers to assess creditworthiness and integrating green lending into credit policy, in keeping with central bank decisions and international board standards. These rules supplement existing ones on prudential supervision, capital buffers, and the broader international regulatory framework for banks. Lastly, the book explores the potential impact of “greenwashing” on SMEs pursuing sustainable practices. To address this, it proposes an approach to measuring sustainability for Italian SMEs based on a survey of 2500 enterprises and provides Matlab tools for investigating green and other sustainable behaviors. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - System thinking is the approach required to understand and analyse complex systems. When systems are complex, their essential properties emerge from the interaction and relationships between parts that cannot be isolated. In such a context, the sustainability challenge requires a mutual synergy between markets and governments to lead the world toward long term prosperity. In order to approach sustainability with a chance of success, it must be seen as multidisciplinary challenge involving different systems interconnected through mutual feedbacks. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to adopt a hybrid approach composed of Agent Based and System Dynamics that: i) analyses the redesign of companies based on industrial symbiosis strategies, and ii) the impact of specific policies on the transition to industrial symbiosis. Results show that industrial symbiosis lies at the core of the positive feedback loop which can support transitioning towards a zero-waste economy. The larger the number of firms adopting symbiosis, the greater the reduction in waste disposal costs and profits and the greater the number of firms engaging in the transition. Policy making can both amplify or reduce the feedback effect by means of public investments and/or tax incentives. The model allows for testing different assumptions in the industrial system while generating a top-down perspective to take effective policies towards a zero-waste economy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Cooperative survival “games” are situations in which, during a sequence of catastrophic events, no one survives unless everyone survives. Such situations can be further exacerbated by uncertainty over the timing and scale of the recurring catastrophes, while the resource management required for survival may depend on several interdependent subgames of resource extraction, distribution, and investment with conflicting priorities and preferences between survivors. In social systems, self-organization has been a critical feature of sustainability and survival; therefore, in this article we use the lens of artificial societies to investigate the effectiveness of socially constructed self-organization for cooperative survival games. We imagine a cooperative survival scenario with four parameters: scale, that is, n in an n-player game; uncertainty, with regard to the occurrence and magnitude of each catastrophe; complexity, concerning the number of subgames to be simultaneously “solved”; and opportunity, with respect to the number of self-organizing mechanisms available to the players. We design and implement a multiagent system for a situation composed of three entangled subgames—a stag hunt game, a common-pool resource management problem, and a collective risk dilemma—and specify algorithms for three self-organizing mechanisms for governance, trading, and forecasting. A series of experiments shows, as perhaps expected, a threshold for a critical mass of survivors and also that increasing dimensions of uncertainty and complexity require increasing opportunity for self-organization. Perhaps less expected are the ways in which self-organizing mechanisms may interact in pernicious but also self-reinforcing ways, highlighting the need for some reflection as a process in collective self-governance for cooperative survival. © 2023, MIT Press Journals.

AB  - The paper investigates potential synergies and trade-offs between emission reduction policies and sustainable development objectives. Specifically, it provides an ex-ante assessment that the impacts of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), submitted under the Paris Agreement, will have on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)of poverty eradication (SDG1)and reduced income inequality (SDG10). Through this research we aim at answering the following questions: does mitigation policy always imply a trade-off with development objectives? If this is the case, what is the magnitude of the effect of the new international climate architecture on poverty and inequality? By combining an empirical analysis with a modelling exercise, the paper estimates the future trends of poverty prevalence and inequality across countries in a reference scenario and under a climate mitigation policy with alternative revenue recycling schemes. Our study finds that a full implementation of the emission reduction contributions, stated in the NDCs, is projected to slow down the effort to reduce poverty by 2030 (+4.2% of the population below the poverty line compared to the baseline scenario), especially in countries that have proposed relatively more stringent mitigation targets and suffer higher policy costs. Conversely, the impact of climate policy on inequality shows opposite sign but remains very limited. If financial support for mitigation action in developing countries is provided through an international climate fund, the prevalence of poverty will be slightly reduced at the aggregate level, but the country-specific effect depends on the relative size of funds flowing to beneficiary countries and on their economic structure. The output of our analysis contributes to the emerging literature on the linkages between climate change policy and sustainable development, although we capture only partially the complex system of interrelations and feedbacks proper of the SDGs. Moreover, due to its policy relevance, it further enriches the debate on the implementation of the Paris Agreement and its climate finance tools. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To redefine the mobility and energy usage patterns in urban cities, the exponential rise in fast-charging loads of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates a new operating paradigm. In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido–Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Complexity economics and transitions studies face the challenging task of accounting for complexity to explain the dynamics of socio-economic systems against the backdrop of grand societal challenges. A promising method to represent and better understand complex systems through simulation is the practice of agent-based modelling (ABM). However, researchers using ABM face the trade-off between capturing the complexity and the ease of designing and interpreting respective models. Beyond highlighting the relevance of using machine learning (ML) as an enabling mechanism for ABM to address this conflict, we provide concrete examples of how employing machine learning techniques with the objectives to increase the accuracy, understanding, and validity of models, can help to capture or process complexity. While we argue in favor of realizing the potentials of the green and digital twin transition in scientific practice, the resulting size and opaqueness of models require researchers to design, interpret, and communicate ML-driven ABM responsibly. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Ping Chen, Wolfram Elsner and Andreas Pyka.

AB  - The integrated energy system facilitates the synergistic and efficient utilization of diverse energy. Establishing interconnected regional energy internets by linking multiple integrated energy systems enables the realization of cross-sector, cross-temporal, and cross-subject energy coupling, consequently enhancing economic benefits, driving profound decarbonization, and bolstering energy resilience. This study develops a multi-agent planning model grounded in an electricity-heat-hydrogen sharing framework, collaboratively optimizing capacity configurations and energy scheduling strategies across various integrated energy systems containing emerging technologies. Furthermore, this study integrates the trading volume and prices of various energy sources to distinguish the energy sharing contribution of each participant, then combines with the Nash bargaining game, forming a fair cooperative benefit allocation incentive mechanism. The proposed model is adeptly solved using the alternating directions method of multipliers, ensuring the protection of participants’ private information. To reflect seasonal characteristics of energy supply and demand, this study uses the daily data of three integrated energy systems across four seasons to simulate. The research results reveal an annual cost saving of 233.73 thousand RMB and a reduction of 290.85 tCO2. Additionally, the impact of variations in electricity operation modes, uncertainties, and emerging technical advances are evaluated to further validate the sustainability of the multi-energy trading mechanism. © 2024

AB  - The response to climate change for example, considering the concept of sustainability, is lagging. Meaning, current Regulation is only limited to slowing the impact of climate change down with an aim of not making the current situation any worse. The circular economy (CE) is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste and pollution and regeneration. The application of CE practices relies upon the deployment of systems thinking, However the effective deployment of systems thinking across the circular economy is only limited to simple ad-hoc interventions. This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) of readiness frameworks that assess the effectiveness of the deployment of circular economic interventions in relation to corporate goals. That includes the effective deployment of systems thinking across the discipline of Asset Management. This SLR differentiates itself from others because it identifies a number of research gaps and proposes a simple concept of a readiness scale that can be used to measure and determine an organisation's or network of organisation's circular economic readiness, being the organisational capacity to carry out planned business activities to fulfil business strategy and planned objectives. This includes incorporating emergent values created from the deployment of complex systems thinking practices. As this research is still a work in progress, this paper does not aim to present a full readiness framework; rather, it presents a progressive step towards the development of a simple readiness scale which will serve as the basis for a holistic CE readiness framework.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Many emerging market countries are bank-based economies and are increasingly affected by geopolitical risks, U.S. dollar dynamics, regulations, preferential trade agreements (PTAs), MNCs (that often function like international organizations), social networks, labor dynamics, cross-border spillovers and the inefficient expansion of formal/informal microfinance. Country risks, informal economies (that account for 20-50 percent of the national economy of many emerging market countries), investor protection, enforcement commitment, compliance costs, sustainability (environmental, social, economic and political sustainability), economic growth, political stability, financial stability, geopolitical risk, social networks, household economics, inequality and international trade outcomes can vary dramatically across many DECs and LDECs due to these phenomena. The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the many problems inherent in political systems, economic policy and governments' emergency powers during pandemics/epidemics and economic/financial crisis. This second volume focuses on geopolitical risks that are intertwined with constitutional political economy and labor issues, alongside addressing some of the financial and constitutional crises that occurred in Europe, Asia and the U.S. during 2007-2020. This book provides analysis of complex systems and the preferences and reasoning of state/government and corporate actors in order to develop better artificial intelligence and decision-system models of geopolitical risk, public policy and international capital flows, all of which are increasingly important decision factors for investment managers, boards-of-directors and government officials. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - This study examines the potential of an integrated bio-commodity supply-production center. Previous research has demonstrated the financial viability of circular bio-economies through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) or simulation. However, these models 1) do not incorporate the necessary logistics operations for biomass collection and storage, 2) do not integrate and optimize those with the requirements of multi-products line lot sizes. A Geographic Information System (GIS) based model is proposed, integrating insertion and genetic algorithms with a hybrid (ABM-DES) simulation model. A case study in Greece's Fthiotida region, a hub for olive cultivation, investigates the production of pellets, olive cakes, and pomace oil from prunings and Two-Phase Olive Mill Waste (TPOMW). The findings suggest that the model allows for a more accurate estimation of impacts when considering the supply and production operations. In particular, it shows how the frequency and lot sizes of replenishment cycles, influenced by the varying numbers of mechanized harvesters employed, significantly impacts the fluctuation observed in the return on investments. Running the model, it is found that the optimized system with two harvesters can reach a breakeven point, within just 36 months, and corresponding emissions of about 622,041 kgCo2eq. This provides a benchmark for other olive industries to harness unexploited resources. © 2024

AB  - Methanol is a key product in the chemical industry, not only for producing other higher economic value chemicals, but also serves as a source of renewable energy that can substantially reduce carbon emissions. However, limited data are available on methanol total supply chain costs that consists of production, biomass cost, investment cost and the efficiency of the conversion processes. This paper recommends using an agent-based simulation–optimization in analyzing and reporting results by system elements (techno-economic assessment) or unit processes (life cycle assessment) as well as by the overall product system, of methanol supply chain. Major decision making are included in the agent-based simulation–optimization model to evaluate methanol synthesis pathways. This evaluation includes biomass and methanol ordering policy, capital budgeting during the lifetime of the methanol supply chain, carbon emissions per metric ton of methanol with specific focus on contribution to Indonesia Gross Domestic Product. The principal results obtained from the agent-based simulation show a better conversion technology pathway that leads to lower carbon emissions, higher internal rate of return, shorter payback period, and less price sensitivity of the methanol supply chain. The article proposes methanol from biogas as the chosen conversion technology pathway by considering its capability of sequestering carbon dioxide from bio-digester and lower capital investment, as well as its economic attractiveness to methanol production investors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The European space-economy represents a complex system with a great internal heterogeneity, intensive socioeconomic interactions and differential growth trajectories among countries and regions. The present study aims to investigate the connectivity between spatial competitiveness and resilience in Europe and seeks to design an operational framework for concerted strategies of competitive and resilient regions. To assess the linkage between resilience and competitiveness, we have developed a new measure, viz. the Resilience and Competitiveness Index (RACI) as a function of two constituent sub-indices: Resilience and Competitiveness. This approach is tested on the basis of detailed data on European regions. The empirical results from 268 EU NUTS2 regions offer a solid anchor point for the proposed operational framework for concerted development strategies of competitive and resilient regions. Our research distinguishes and proposes several systematic types of concerted regional strategies according to the performance of a region measured by Resilience and Competiveness sub-indices. A key result of the study is the design of an operational constellation for strategic regional policy evaluation, with a major added value for policy- and decision-making purposes. The use of official data from Eurostat and of standard indicators in our research assures continuity and consistency with the official Regional Competitiveness Index (RCI) classification and measurement, so that policy makers are able to compare the performance of their regions over time and to develop proper concerted strategies accordingly. The clear evidence of a connectivity between regional competitiveness and resilience may help to develop a governance approach that balances competitiveness (mainly represented by productive assets) with resilience (mainly represented by sustainability and ecological awareness) and thus to deal with the complexity in socioeconomic systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The fight against poverty in the Peruvian Andes is a complex task in which various professionals, such as engineers, economists, anthropologists, among others, participate. The uncertainty of the decisions taken today, no matter how appropriate they may seem, such as million-dollar investments in irrigation infrastructure, can result in overproduction and, therefore, in economic recessions. For this reason, a new mathematical simulation model is proposed using system dynamics to predict recession phenomena that can occur in months or after a few years of auspicious economic growth, and that can cause sales prices to be below production costs. The author has developed the conceptualization of the production system of irrigation improvement projects in several years of multidisciplinary work in the Cusco region of Peru. The primary objective of irrigation projects is to improve the socio-economic conditions of the farmer. Techniques as the fulfillment of goals have been used to quantify qualitative dimensions such as strengthening organizations and trainings that are key to guaranteeing irrigation improvement projects' sustainability in the long term. Therefore, it has been possible to identify the variables and relationships of this type of socio-economic system. To validate the model, we verified that the simulated data are consistent with the historical data collected. Likewise, if the values of the various proposed models' variables are adequately modified, these can be applied to other types of production systems under different market conditions. The dimensions addressed, such as supply, demand, sale price, land, production volume, public budget, etc., enhance the research's importance, making the simulation model formally expressed also acquire nuances from economic theory for the fight against poverty-based on water. One of the study's conclusions is to understand the production systems, it is necessary to see them in the context of their regional economy's behavior. © 2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy security has become a worldwide issue in recent years. Coal resources security (CRS), an important part of energy security, has been an emerging concern in many countries, due to the diminishing fossil energy reserve and unbalanced energy structure. However, there is no universally agreed method of constructing indicator system for CRS assessment. Subjectivity in the process of evaluation also affects the results of assessment. Moreover, CRS is a complex system that should be evaluated scientifically under diverse methods. Therefore, we constructed an indicator system and evaluation model of CRS and used a case study of China and 31 provinces in its mainland to evaluate CRS at both national and provincial levels. The indicator system included two subsystems-long-term CRS and short-term CRS. We also chose a few elements and factors that are consistent with China's reality. Different research methods were used: the entropy-weight-based TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method is applied to evaluate the degree of CRS, which avoids the subjectivity of weight determination and reflects the relative merit of each indicator; the BP (Back-Propagation) Neural Network method is used to analyze the sensitivity of CRS to each index. The results show that the national level of CRS dropped in the early years but slowly picked up with the help of government intervention. Investment in coal industry development resulted in the immediate effect of improving CRS. The positive impact of maintaining environmental sustainability is stable over either the short, medium, or long term. The degrees of CRS vary significantly across provinces, even between those with similar coal stock levels. Extra attention should be paid to the transportation of coal resources among provinces and intervention to balance supply and demand within the regions. © 2020 by authors.

AB  - Building practitioners often fail to achieve beyond-compliance with residential energy performance standards, jeopardizing industry sustainability. Governments increasingly employ policies to drive behavior change toward beyond-compliance. However, the influence of interventions on building practitioners' compliance behavior remains underexplored, along with the consideration of social interactions among these practitioners. This study aims to assess the influence of interventions on building practitioners' beyond-compliance in Australia. Two specific objectives are set accordingly: To identify the specific behavioral constructs impacted by interventions; and to evaluate the extent of behavior change resulting from interventions, particularly in achieving better beyond-compliance outcomes. Data was gathered from a survey of 73 building practitioners involved in residential design, including architects, designers, builders, project managers, and thermal performance assessors. Agent-based modeling was used to simulate behavior changes compared to initial self-reported behavior states under the influence of two widely implemented policies: training and financial incentive. The findings show that while training improves knowledge of energy-efficient designs, it does not lead to tangible improvements in achieving beyond-compliance outcomes. Conversely, financial incentive effectively drives behavior change in delivering homes that are beyond-compliance by offsetting perceived high compliance costs. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry advisory bodies, enabling them to develop more targeted interventions that align with building practitioners' interests, ultimately contributing to the sustainability of the residential building sector. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Automated Vehicles (AVs) are poised to disrupt travel patterns and the sustainability of transportation networks. Conventional methods for studying these changes, such as stated preference surveys and agent-based simulations, have limitations. Serious games offer a promising alternative, providing a controlled and engaging environment for investigating travel behavior. In our study, 200 participants, grouped into sessions of 10, engaged in a competitive serious game simulating 50 daily choices of travel mode and departure time across three automated options. Two scenarios were examined: one with recurring congestion and another with nonrecurring congestion. Automated transit had fixed schedules, while private and shared rides could adapt to a congested bottleneck. Results revealed that ridesharing dominated, reaching 60% mode share under recurring congestion, displacing transit, and a comparative equilibrium emerged between shared and private rides. In the nonrecurring congestion scenario, ridesharing dropped to 37%, and a comparable multimodal equilibrium developed. Participants rarely achieved the optimal score, attaining a maximum of 88% of its potential. This study highlights a policy paradox: unregulated AV traffic can reduce transit use, exacerbate recurring congestion, yet necessitate increased transit investment to address nonrecurring congestion, confirming the Downs-Thomson paradox. Creating appealing mass transit alternatives is imperative to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the era of automated mobility. © 2024

AB  - Moving to a circular economy (CE) is crucial for achieving sustainability. However, many industries face challenges to make the transition. Industries function as complex systems, encompassing multiple business ecosystems (BEs) influenced by a myriad of market forces. Due to the absence of a single point of control, the evolution of industries and their BEs can follow various paths. If transitioning to a CE is a desired outcome, understanding the guidelines and restrictions - or 'rules' - that facilitate the emergence of circular BEs within industries is essential. This research therefore investigates the transition to a CE in the chemicals manufacturing industry through the lens of BEs, system theory, and orchestration theory. A two-stage instrumental case study was conducted, beginning with focus group discussions involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the chemical industry, followed by the analysis of a specific circular laundry detergent BE. Our findings deepen the understanding of CE, especially within the chemicals industry, by unveiling seven system rules that govern the transition. These rules emphasise the importance of motivations, challenges, cross-sector collaborations, and BE orchestration. Furthermore, our study highlights the consumers' readiness for circular value propositions and the pressing need for both private and governmental investment to scale up. Additionally, our findings shed light on the potential for synergies between highly carbon-intensive industries in the realm of CE. Despite the complexity of managing such intricate relationships, it is argued that fair distribution of gains and burdens can sustain circular BEs in the long run, which ultimately contributes to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Pandemic events, particularly the current Covid-19 disease, compel organisations to re-formulate their day-to-day operations for achieving various business goals such as cost reduction. Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks. In the real-world case study, an accuracy rate of 82% is achieved, which indicates the potential of the proposed framework in assisting business sustainability pertaining to asset predictive maintenance under pandemic environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The integration of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the modern business environment, which is increasingly focused on sustainability, is further complicated by the emergence of dual-channel closed-loop supply chains (DCCLSCs). Our study examines the unexplored complexities of integrating CSR practices into this complex system, considering the growing focus on supply chains and societal expectations. Using equilibrium analysis and numerical simulations, this study intends to investigate how different recycling channel structures affect optimal CSR investments, the resulting impact on pricing and recycling rates, and the interaction with consumer channel preferences. Our findings indicate that increased consumer sensitivity to CSR correlates with increased profitability and recycling rates, providing a strategic advantage to the manufacturer. This study provides a novel contribution by revealing the operational and ethical complexities of CSR integration in DCCLSCs. It encourages enterprises to incorporate CSR efforts with consumer education and to synchronize pricing and recycling strategies for mutual benefit, thereby providing manufacturers and retailers with actionable strategies for achieving sustainable and profitable operations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Low-carbon finance markets are complex systems of heterogeneous actors operating across the globe. They have diverse investment preferences and risk appetites, and their collective interactions and dynamics shape investment flows into low-carbon assets. Using the case of solar, wind and hydro energy technologies, this chapter explores the complexity in low-carbon finance markets, defined as markets that direct capital flows towards low-carbon technologies, using network approaches to study their structure and dynamics. Identifying key actors and their interactions, and understanding the evolutionary and adaptive processes which shape flows of low-carbon investments will be critical to design effective public finance and policy instruments for accelerating the deployment of low-carbon assets and realizing the climate transition. © Editors and Contributors Severally 2024.

AB  - The rise of distributed energy generation through solar panels in homes and businesses sparks the creation of fresh energy markets. This shift removes the old boundaries between energy suppliers and users, leading to the emergence of energy 'prosumers.' Blockchain technology enhances safe and affordable direct energy swaps within a decentralized setup, employing encryption and consensus checks. The research utilized a unique approach called 'Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) along with Geographic Information System (GIS)' to assess energy trading within the real estate sector. This process encompassed gathering and analyzing data about daily energy consumption to grasp market dynamics and construct a decentralized energy trading approach. The initial simulation involved five key stages: collecting, processing, predicting, analyzing, confirming, and evaluating performance. The primary actors in this model were individuals, consumers, energy providers, and producers. The outcomes from the experiments indicated that one could assess the distinct households' features by incorporating GIS data and an agent-centric model. Harnessing high-performance computing makes it possible to manage large-scale simulations involving multiple participants. Generally, this approach is anticipated to enhance the model's efficiency and offer a flexible environment for scrutinizing how energy blockchain impacts finance, technology, and society. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Limited evidence and less comprehensive approach to post-project sustainability evaluation has raised the need for incorporating complexity concepts in project sustainability evaluation. This study aims to develop a project sustainability evaluation framework by using a complex systems approach and to apply the framework to a microfinance project in Indonesia. This qualitative research is based on thematic analysis. The components of the proposed framework involve mission, input, process, output, performance, governance (including stakeholders, subsystems and feedback mechanisms) and the environment of the projects. Results show that the framework is able to provide comprehensive information including project sustainability dimensions and routinization, the possibility to detect ineffective or undesirable practices, project governance, its performance, the persistent practice and changes. The application to the microfinance project reveals that the microfinance project can achieve sustainability without subsidies by achieving financial goals while maintaining social missions. Implications for project sustainability and microfinance are discussed. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This research develops a simple interdisciplinary, agent-based, multi-hazard risk interaction model with an integrated dynamic adaptive pathways planning component and uses it to investigate impacts of representative concentration pathway (RCP), shared socio-economic pathway (SSP), and three different cost apportionment schemes to the form and function of a shallow coastal human-environment system 130 years into the future. Here, ‘Cost apportionment’ refers to the decisions related to who pays for climate change adaptation: 1) individuals, 2) governments, or 3) a mixture of individual and government responsibility. We explored how the cost apportionment decision influences the cost and availability of building insurance in a complex human-environment system. RCP proves to be the main driver of economic impacts and insurance availability - higher insurance costs are associated with higher greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and vice versa. Slightly higher insurance premiums relative to building values are seen when costs are entirely borne by central and local government, rather than if costs are entirely borne by individuals within the insurance market, or with a mixed payment approach, but the difference in premiums driven by cost apportionment is an order of magnitude lower than the impact of RCP. Cost apportionment has no discernable impact on insurance availability in any scenario. This research demonstrates that, 1) simple agent-based models are useful for highlighting socio-economic impacts of multiple interacting hazards and cost apportionment on system form and function (where system refers to geophysical, hydrological, social, political, economic and cultural interactions); and 2) multi-hazard risk interaction analysis can be meaningfully undertaken using a simple rule-based code structure. The impacts shown herein indicate the capacity of the human-environment system of our selected case study example - a suburb within a New Zealand coastal city - to bear the financial costs incurred by various alternate cost apportionment options and climate change scenarios. © 2022 Australasian Coasts and Ports 2021 - Proceedings.

AB  - Agrifood chains are complex systems; they encompass biological, economic, social, health and political variables at different scales (e.g., on-farm, local, regional, national and global). Consequently, what enables a food system to achieve 'sustainability' is also complex. This is particularly the case in small-scale societies in developing nations which are socially constituted. In this paper we posit that a habitus of informality underpins food systems' sustainability in these societies. We argue that conventional applications of approaches like the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) and Circles of Sustainability (CoS) frameworks fail to assist understanding of sustainability in informal socio-economic systems because they either place too much emphasis on economic growth (TBL) or underplay the strength of socio-cultural obligations and responsibilities (CoS). This is seen in international aid programs that encourage economic growth in the agrifood sector, which is challenging for villages in such societies. We review data from two Pacific Island countries-Tonga and Solomon Islands-to demonstrate the need for a more holistic way to think about sustainability in informal agrifood systems in small-scale developing nations. We demonstrate the value of employing a Hybrid Value Chain Framework for collecting information necessary to understanding how sustainability is constituted in the food systems of small-scale societies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Many regular business operations are transforming into digital services, increasing advanced multi-platforms, rapid operational alignment, flexibility, and environmental impact through energy consumption, hardware waste, and technology investments. Flexible and sustainable system development models emphasizing energy efficiency can help innovate software development as digital servicing applications shift. This research is motivated by the need to improve energy consumption in early software design and development due to rising technological efficiency and sustainability demands. Although effective in iterative development and stakeholder engagement, traditional Agile methodologies often struggle with long-term sustainability and energy efficiency. Extended Agile, combining Agile, layered architecture, and aspect-oriented frameworks (ALAI), promises to improve system modularity, flexibility, maintainability, and sustainability. This study’s findings are not just theoretical, but also practically relevant, as they explore the energy efficiency of ALAI software development methodologies, using graduate admission information system services (GAISS) as an example. GAISS is a complex system that handles the entire process of graduate admissions, from application submission to final decision. The study quantifies the energy usage of a student-list webpage by analyzing Microsoft IIS server logs from February 2022 to May 2024. Directly applicable findings show that the GAISS based on the ALAI framework reduces energy consumption by 10.7914% compared to traditional Agile software developments. ALAI used 892.80 kWh versus Agile’s 1000.80 kWh during operations, saving energy. These findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating aspect-oriented frameworks and layering approaches into Agile methodologies, contributing to sustainable software development discourse. The study emphasizes the importance of energy-efficient frameworks such as ALAI to reduce software systems’ environmental impact and promote software development sustainability. The findings of this study, with their practical relevance, assist software developers and organizations in choosing software design and development methods that maximize operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Taiwan’s encouragement of installing solar photovoltaic power plants (SPPPs) on warehouse rooftops is a step towards sustainability and profitable investment. This study, analyzing the installations of STY Company, found that rooftop SPPPs significantly boost revenue, with rates increasing from 2.0088% to 6.8681% over 20 years. The break-even point is in the 7th year, with a return rate ranging from 2.0088 to 2.1748%. This shows that SPPP investments are a benefit for investors, shortening construction times and allowing warehouses to sell solar energy at an earlier date. This research utilized a fuzzy nonlinear multi-objective programming model to examine trade-offs between construction time, cost, quality, and revenue (TCQR) to optimize SPPP construction. The findings suggest that reducing construction time is an effective strategy to lower carbon emissions despite potential cost increases. However, time and quality costs are inversely proportional, highlighting the importance of efficient project management in minimizing the impacts of this trade-off. Adjusting funding can maintain quality while speeding up construction. Completing projects early also heightens revenue from green energy sales, offsetting higher initial investments. The TCQR focuses on investment revenue, managing time efficiently, and making data-driven decisions to expedite SPPP development. This model improves project profitability and promotes sustainable growth by reducing construction time and optimizing financial strategies. This study’s contribution includes: 1. Optimizing the installation process of warehouse rooftop SPPPs, which provide significant long-term revenue and environmental benefits. 2. Combining the different research methods of scholars into fuzzy methods that can solve complex systems with high uncertainty. The nonlinear model put forth by this study is closer to the actual situation and can handle balancing complex problems in multi-objective programming. 3. Improving the efficiency of time management to make it feasible to reduce construction time to lower carbon emissions. 4. Concocting a comprehensive approach integrating financial, environmental, and operational factors for successful SPPP development. This study addresses an academic gap. Previously, scholars conducted research independently, focusing solely on financial investment or time, cost, and quality (TCQ) issues without considering the two together. By combining financial investment with TCQ, this study fills a significant gap in academic research. According to this study, better investment returns could improve the promotion of solar energy. Unlike previous research, this study integrates the analysis of TCQ with that of revenue by assessing costs and revenues together. This approach allows decision-makers to derive judgments from the TCQR model quickly. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - The eco-economic system is a complex system based on human activities, and the sustainability of the eco-economic system needs to maintain the balance between the three subsystems of society, economy, and environment. In this work, a comprehensive evaluation index system of the ecological-economic system of Liaoning Province in China was constructed by combining the emergy analysis and the system dynamic (SD) model, and four development scenarios were designed by adjusting the influencing factors of the ecological-economic system, based on the simulation and evaluation of the sustainable ecological and economic development of Liaoning Province from 2017 through to the next 19 years. The conclusion shows that, under the scenario of coordinated development type, the GDP, emergy density, and emergy output rate of Liaoning Province show an increasing trend; the ecological load, such as waste emergy ratio and environmental load rate, is small; and the sustainable development index and emergy sustainable development index are at a high level compared to other programs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Enterprises operate as complex systems embedded in dynamic environments characterized by global interdependencies, technological advancements, and systemic challenges. This paper examines the critical components, challenges, and resilience strategies necessary for modern organizations to navigate complexity and uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage revealed vulnerabilities in interconnected supply chains, financial markets, and digital ecosystems, underscoring the need for systemic adaptability. Technological advancements, including artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and big data, add layers of operational complexity, demanding robust data management, cybersecurity measures, and seamless integration with legacy systems. The paper highlights the growing demand for sustainable and ethical practices, driven by regulatory pressures, consumer expectations, and advocacy group influence. Businesses are compelled to balance short-term efficiency with long-term adaptability to thrive in a volatile environment shaped by rapid technological, market, and societal changes. Case studies of organizations such as Toyota, Amazon, and Unilever illustrate how viewing enterprises as interconnected systems allows them to address root causes of challenges, implement resilience strategies, and leverage adaptability as a competitive advantage. Theoretical frameworks, including systems thinking, complex adaptive systems (CAS), and the Viable System Model, provide tools for understanding enterprise complexity. These frameworks emphasize interdependencies, nonlinearities, feedback loops, and emergent behaviors that define organizational systems. The paper explores the concept of resilience, emphasizing adaptability, recovery, and thriving amidst disruptions as critical elements of long-term sustainability. Challenges such as resistance to change, coordination across subsystems, and the trade-off between efficiency and resilience are analyzed within the context of enterprise architecture, Normal Accident Theory, and the Swiss Cheese Model. The study advocates for adopting resilience engineering and collective mindfulness to anticipate, detect, and manage errors effectively, ensuring organizational stability and growth. By framing enterprises as dynamic, adaptive systems, this paper contributes actionable insights for building resilience, fostering sustainability, and managing complexity in an era of unprecedented disruption. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Energy is at the basis of any social or economic development. The fossil energy is the most used energy source in the world due to the cheap building cost of the power plants. In 2017, fossil fuels generated 64.5% of the world electricity. Since, on the one hand, these plants produce large amount of carbon dioxide which drives climate change, and on the other hand, the storage of existing world fossil resources is in continuous decrease, safer and highly available energy sources should be considered. Hence, for human well-being, and for a green environment, these fossil plants should be switched to cleaner ones. Renewable energy resources have begun to be used as alternatives. These resources have many advantages such as sustainability and environmental protection. Nevertheless, they require higher investment costs. In addition, the reliability of many planted systems is poor. In most cases these systems are not sufficient to ensure a continuous demand of energy for all in needy regions because most of their resources are climate dependent. The main contributions of this research are (i) to propose a natural formalisation of the renewable energy distribution problem, based on COP (Constraint Optimisation Problem), that takes into consideration all the constraints related to this problem; (ii) to propose a novel multi-agent dynamic (A-RESS for Agent based Renewable Energy Sharing System) to solve this problem. The proposed system was implemented and the obtained results show its efficiency and performance in terms of produced, consumed and lost energy. © 2021 Toumia and Ben Hassine. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Water supply and demand management (WSDM) is essential for developing sustainable cities and societies. WSDM is only effective when tackled from the perspective of a holistic system understanding that considers social, environmental, hydrological, and economic (SEHEc) sub-systems. System dynamics modeling (SDM) is recommended by water resource researchers as it models the biophysical and socio-economic systems simultaneously. This study presents a comprehensive literature review of SDM applications in sustainable WSDM. The reviewed articles were methodologically analyzed considering SEHEc sub-systems and the type of modeling approach used. This study revealed that problem conceptualization using the causal loop diagram (CLD) was performed in only 58% of the studies. Moreover, 70% of the reviewed articles used the stock flow diagram (SFD) to perform a quantitative system analysis. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement plays a significant role in understanding the core issues and divergent views and needs of users, but it was incorporated by only 36% of the studies. Although climate change significantly affects water management strategies, only 51% of the reviewed articles considered it. Although the scenario analysis is supported by simulation models, they further require the optimization models to yield optimal key parameter values. One noticeable finding is that only 12% of the articles used quantitative models to complement SDM for the decision-making process. The models included agent-based modeling (ABM), Bayesian networking (BN), analytical hierarchy approach (AHP), and simulation optimization multi-objective optimization (MOO). The solution approaches included the genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The key findings for the sustainable development of water resources included the per capita water reduction, water conservation through public awareness campaigns, the use of treated wastewater, the adoption of efficient irrigation practices including drip irrigation, the cultivation of low-water-consuming crops in water-stressed regions, and regulations to control the overexploitation of groundwater. In conclusion, it is established that SDM is an effective tool for devising strategies that enable sustainable water supply and demand management. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - To meet the demands for resources, food and energy, especially in fast developing countries in the Global South, new infrastructure investments, technologies and supply chains are required. It is essential to manage a transition that minimises the impacts on global environmental degradation while benefits local socio-economic development. Food-bioenergy integration optimising natural capital resources and considering wider environmental and socio-economic sustainability offers a way forward. This study presents an integrative approach enabling whole systems modelling to address the interlinkage and interaction of resource-food-bioenergy systems and optimise supply chains considering poly-centric decision spaces. Life cycle sustainability assessment, optimisation, agent-based modelling and simulation were coupled to build an integrated systems modelling framework applicable to the resource-food-bioenergy nexus. The model building blocks are described before their applications in three case studies addressing agricultural residues and macro-fungi in the Philippines, sugar cane biorefineries in South Africa, and Nipa palm biofuel in Thailand. Our case studies revealed the great potential of untapped biomass including agricultural waste and non-food biomass grown on marginal lands. Two value chain integration case studies – i.e. straw-fungi-energy in Philippines and sugar-energy in Africa – have been suggested as sustainable solutions to recover waste as value-added products to meet food and energy security. Case studies highlight how an integrative modelling framework can be applied to address multi-level questions, taking into account decision-making at different levels, which contribute to an overall sustainability goal. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy efficiency can help facing the climate crises. Yet the energy intensity has decreased more slowly than required to achieve climate goals. Based on this premise, we build an agent-based model to study the effects of different energy efficiency policies. Policies analysed range from indirect policies – taxes, incentives, and subsidies – to direct technological policies, where a public research laboratory invests in R&D to establish a new technological energy efficiency paradigm. Results reveal that, although most of the policies effectively reduce energy intensity, the research lab is the most efficient in promoting energy efficiency without negative impacts on macroeconomic and public finance conditions. However, the success of this policy requires a long-term commitment, highlighting the importance of complementing this strategy with more “ready to use” measures. The findings also indicate that most policies do not induce significant macroeconomic rebound effects. Concerns about macroeconomic rebound effects may likely be overstated. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Today’s economic systems are, on the one hand, exposed to various risks and uncertainties with their trends changing almost daily, while on the other hand, they represent an extremely complex system with a large number of sustainable influential parameters. The challenge is to model macroeconomic parameters and achieve sustainability, yet also satisfy conflict situations with an increased level of uncertainty. The aim of this paper is to create an appropriate functional model by examining the mutual influence of various macroeconomic factors. It assesses a total of four scenarios considering mutual influences of: FDI (foreign direct investments), GDP (gross domestic product), imports, exports, inflation rate, RER (real exchange rate) and employment rate as defined parameters. First, the DEA (Data envelopment analysis) model was applied to determine the initial efficiency of two countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) and Serbia, for the period 2005–2020. Then, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied in combination with DEA to obtain more precise values. In addition, IMF SWARA (Improved Fuzzy Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) was applied to define weight coefficients of macro-economic parameters. Finally, the CRADIS (compromise ranking of alternatives from distance to ideal solution) model was applied for the final ranking of part of decision-making units. This developed, integrated model can be classified as a mathematical method for economic analysis and gives extended opportunities for solving different problems. The results show that 2009, 2013 and 2016 were the most favorable years in terms of the conditions set when it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and 2012, 2014 and 2016 when it comes to Serbia. These years have been singled out and can be a benchmark for further handling and modeling of macroeconomic elements. In addition, correlation was tested using statistical coefficients. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The trans-disciplinary nature and extent of the construction supply chain make it prone to inefficiencies at its component domain/segment boundaries. Project-centric delivery accentuates these. Logistics, a significant element of the construction supply chain, forms part of complex systems with multiple stakeholders and a wide range of concurrent on-/off-site in-action activities, processes, and systems. Transport is the largest logistics component, with most other processes (except warehousing) being business processes and not ‘real’ ones. The low-value/high-volume nature of construction materials leads to substantial transport requirement, even for small projects, with costs up to half the logistics costs or a fifth of construction costs. Transport is naturally fragmented, with a component intrinsic to every business, and asset ownership and deployment typically external to it. Incremental inefficiencies, driven by siloed planning between involved stakeholders, aggregate into visibility at the macro level. Adverse sustainability impacts are the obvious consequence. Transport optimisation results from re-configuring activities, re-combining resources, and re-positioning actors, which demand integrated strategic and/or operational planning. This paper undertakes data-driven analysis of an integrated business model as a ‘smart’ solution for improved transport efficiency in a specific New Zealand construction supply chain segment. Quantification and validation of sustainability benefits is undertaken using domestic/international parameters. © 2023 and published by the Architectural Science Association (ANZAScA).

AB  - In the evolving landscape of blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, the quest for decentralized governance has led to the advent of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs offer a groundbreaking framework where token holders directly influence the management and strategic direction of decentralized structures. This study delves into the concept of DAO through the lens of No1s1, an experimental project embodying a self-sustaining architecture governed autonomously. No1s1 stands out as a physical space that operates independently, rewarding participants with tokens for performing maintenance tasks crucial for its upkeep. In this contribution, we employ agent-based modelling to simulate interactions between participants and No1s1, exploring the dynamics of the token economy, participatory governance, and the sustainability of such an autonomous entity. By examining the reciprocal maintenance relationship and its impact on No1s1's longevity and wealth, this study sheds light on the potential and challenges of DAO- governed structures.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Critical infrastructure behaves as a complex system with many interacting parts, geographically distant subsystems, distributed control, evolutionary development and emergent behavior. This research aims to review the ongoing transformation of critical infrastructure systems, with a focus on identifying factors influencing system changes and the gaps in understanding increasing system interconnections and interdependencies. In this research, critical infrastructure systems incorporating cyber and human-social characteristics have been mapped using a water utility example. The research found that rapid technology advancements, increasing dependencies on data and analytics, changing community expectations and attitudes to sustainability, equality and public health and adaption due to climate change and natural disasters are transforming these systems, increasing interconnections. With increasing interconnections and interdependencies, these large physical asset systems are becoming cyber-physical-human systems. Consequently, existing studies in the literature do not provide an effective understanding of the complex interactions of system components, emergent behaviors and points of evolving risk in such cyber-physical-human critical infrastructure systems. New safety, security and resilience challenges are emerging in the ongoing transformation, which requires better understanding to enable earlier identification of potential risks.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Stock portfolio optimization is the process of continuous reallocation of funds to a selection of stocks. This is a particularly well-suited problem for reinforcement learning, as daily rewards are compounding and objective functions may include more than just profit, e.g., risk and sustainability. We developed a novel utility function with the Sharpe ratio representing risk and the environmental, social, and governance score (ESG) representing sustainability. We show that a state- of-the-art policy gradient method - multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradients (MADDPG) - fails to find the optimum policy due to flat policy gradients and we therefore replaced gradient descent with a genetic algorithm for parameter optimization. We show that our system outperforms MADDPG while improving on deep Q-learning approaches by allowing for continuous action spaces. Crucially, by incorporating risk and sustainability criteria in the utility function, we improve on the state-of-the-art in reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization; risk and sustainability are essential in any modern trading strategy, and we propose a system that does not merely report these metrics, but that actively optimizes the portfolio to improve on them.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Since the beginning of the well-drilling activities of oil and gas industry, in the 19th century, these activities have presented specific risks that, over the course of their evolution to the present day, have greatly increased their potential to cause harm to people, the environment, and corporate sustainability. Stimulated by the world’s energy needs, especially in developed and growing countries, the technology used by the O&G industry has evolved significantly, not only to increase production and profit levels, but also to reduce the risks of these activities, using reliable automation and other barriers to worker protection. However, despite all this investment, accidents such as the Deepwater Horizon, in 2010, and Odebrecht NS-32, in 2017, shown that there are still gaps in this process of evolution of protection systems, especially those used in highly complex systems such as offshore oil rigs. In addition, inevitably, the technological contribution implemented in offshore drilling systems increases their complexity and, consequently, also increases the complexity of the relationship between workers, systems, machines, and environment, definitively characterizing oil rigs as complex socio-technical systems. Keeping that in mind, a FRAM model was developed to understand the levels of complexity and show the relevant human factors that are critical for the safe operations of these workplaces, considering the natural and variability that emerges from these labour scenarios. Some functions of the FRAM model built presented significant variability, as function “Perform drilling operations”, where the most significant variabilities were observed in its 10 outputs, causing a large resonance within the model, once their couplings, mostly in their control aspects, can vary in terms of time and precision. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals express a narrative about the relationships between people and nature. This paper builds a narrative from an ocean perspective – through the lens of a coral reef seascape, and the blue economy. The ocean, intimately connected with the land, freshwater flows and climate provides a vast array of benefits to humanity. These benefits are valued at trillions of dollars per year globally, supporting hundreds of millions of jobs, and contributing to all countries both coastal and inland, through living and non-living resources, transport infrastructure and natural products, and sustainable energy solutions; the coastal zone is home to half the world's population. Through these direct benefits, the ocean contributes to reduced hunger and poverty, improved health, and all these benefits may be shared across gender, social and national boundaries. However accessing ocean benefits results in pressures that may drive decline in ocean health. Managing this complex system for a sustainable blue economy requires developing and using the right knowledge, new governance mechanisms and investment by stakeholders from global to local levels. This ‘blue economy’ narrative builds on the links between ocean health (SDG14) and economy (SDG8), but the general model can be expressed from the perspective of any goal(s) towards the others. The model also applies across scales from local to global, the relationships defined in the model enabling monitoring and assessment. The model can thus help align global instruments such as the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework with Agenda 2030, and linking from national to grassroots levels. © 2020

AB  - Digitalization is introducing a virtual representation of the physical world. Such virtual or digital assets, interconnected via global communication network, open unbounded management opportunities that are realized in form of software. Nowadays, digitalization is not a matter of technology change, but is rather perceived as a prerequisite of modern and sustainable operation. Thus, proactive digitalization continuously increases the complexity of globally interconnected software systems and new emerging technologies may bring significant improvements in their management. Management and sustainable goals depend on sound and effective software system engineering solutions. In this paper, we discuss modeling complex software systems within a water supply case study, in which digitalization is introduced to accomplish sustainable goals. Our focus is on water leak report and repair process, for which we open interesting further research and development challenges, based on our previous experiences in modeling complex software systems and in modeling software failure report and repair process. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a potent tool for evaluating the ecological consequences of various products and processes. However, with a plethora of LCA software tools (ST) available, selecting the most appropriate tool for a specific application can be quite challenging. This research paper aims to compare two popular LCA Tools, GaBi- a commercial software, and openLCA- an open-source, for a traditional tool manufacturing case study. The comparison considers factors such as userfriendliness, user support, modelling capability, cost, flexibility, comprehensiveness, and functionality. Impact categories representing human health, ecosystem, and resource consumption were chosen. The case study evaluated the Cradle-to-gate manufacturing of a turbine die made by traditional machining processes and used as a wax injection moulding die for investment casting. The study found that aluminum production and manufacturing were the highest contributors to total environmental impact due to electricity consumption and aluminium waste. The results indicate that each ST has unique features and capabilities suitable for specific applications. We calculated relative deviations as the ratio of maximum to minimum calculated impacts for comparison. Ozone depletion (22.57) and freshwater eutrophication (4.2) had the highest variation. Significant deviations in human toxicity (3.16) were observed using the ReCiPe, while climate change (1.58 and 1.66) was accurately assessed by both CML and ReCiPe. GaBi is found to be the most user-friendly and efficient tool for beginners, with great modelling capability and flexibility to handle complex systems, while openLCA is the most comprehensive tool for analyzing complex systems, grants functionality, and is freely available suggested for experienced users. This research paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of LCA ST for traditional tool manufacturing applications, which can help manufacturers make informed decisions in selecting the most suitable ST for their LCA needs. © 2024 School of Science, DUTH.

AB  - The construction of an efficient financial-investment model for social security system is of paramount importance for ensuring the well-being and social stability of the population. In this regard, the AB-SFC modeling method presents promising opportunities for analyzing and assessing the dynamics of social security systems. This research investigates the possibilities of utilizing the AB-SFC modeling method to develop an efficient financial-investment model for addressing poverty and income inequality in social security provision. By employing the AB-SFC approach, which combines agent-based modeling (ABM) with stock-flow-consistent (SFC) modeling, this study aims to enhance the accuracy and realism of financial simulations in social security systems. Through an analysis of poverty and income inequality within the population, this research examines how the AB-SFC modeling method can contribute to understanding and mitigating these socioeconomic challenges. This study investigates the capabilities of the AB-SFC modeling method in capturing the key features of social security, including contributions, benefits, investments, and demographic factors, while accounting for the dynamic interactions among households, government entities, and financial institutions. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of AB-SFC modeling and offers recommendations for policymakers to design effective strategies for reducing poverty and income inequality within the context of social security. The findings highlight the value of the AB-SFC modeling method in constructing an efficient financial-investment model for social security and provide insights into its potential applications in enhancing the ESG sustainability and effectiveness of social security systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - In recent years there was a significant of international structures that are being created as platforms for multilateral policy dialogue on climate change issues outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Such structures are, for example, the Major Economies Forum (MEF), the Petersberg Climate Dialogue, the on Clean Energy Ministerial and a wide variety of partnerships. There is no common definition for such formats of cooperation and conceptual ground for understanding their place in international climate governance system. This includes both traditional interstate cooperation mechanisms embodied by the UNFCCC, as well as non-state initiatives, climate finance institutions, formats that support a constant dialogue between states, business representatives, academia, and NGOs on climate policy issues. The aim of the study was to clarify the nature of quasi-formal climate governance, to establish a typology and assess of the dynamics of development of quasi-formal entities to better understand the processes of its formation and implementation. I describe three types of quasi-formal entities from the new dataset of quasi-formal entities created in the period from 2001-2022: intergovernmental forums, UNFCCC party groupings, and hybrid partnerships. The study reveals an increase in the number of political forums and hybrid partnerships amid stabilization or even reduction of negotiating blocs within the UNFCCC. In complex system of international climate governance, quasi-formal entities are playing an increasing role in the accumulation and exchange of knowledge and experience between states on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. © global governance, informal governance, climate negotiations, UNFCCC, partnerships

AB  - The Extended Exergy Analysis (EEA) is an exergy-based accounting method that allows for the internalization of the so-called “externalities” (Labour, Capital and Environmental Cost) neglected by a simple Exergy Analysis (EA). While in Thermoeconomics the cost of each exergy flux is expressed in monetary units, in EEA the measuring basis is the equivalent primary exergy needed to maintain the whole supply chain, “from cradle to grave”; EEA can be considered a de facto “extension” of the Cumulative Exergy Content (CExC) theory. Some recent developments in the way researchers address the sustainability issue confirm that a purely monetary approach may result in misleading conclusions; thence, a purely resource-based method as EEA is a good candidate for the analysis of “energy Conversion” systems at large, because the convenience of a process is not driven solely by monetary profit but requires the quantification of environmental and social factors. This paper introduces a novel approach to EEA, enabled by an extensive basis of relevant information about material-, energy- and monetary fluxes and labour statistics currently available from public and private data banks at a disaggregation level never experienced in the past. A proper organization of this large data set leads to a very detailed and accurate allocation of the material- and immaterial- flows involved in the EEA of a large complex system, like a whole country. The method is useful to make a comparison between the performance of different “transition to sustainability” policies, and it is suitable for a systematic implementation of modular computational procedures; It may thus lead to a rational, unbiased and standardized tool suitable for the conception and evaluation of short- and long-term policies. © Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

AB  - In a hyperconnected and turbulent world, resilience has become an essential business competency that strengthens risk management. Resilience is defined as the capacity for complex systems to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of turbulent change, including gradual stresses and sudden shocks. Modern resilience strategies can help enterprises to embrace change rather than clinging to historical practices. By designing both facilities and supply chain processes for increased flexibility, visibility, and agility, organizations can improve their resilience to unforeseen disruptions, thus contributing to profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, resilience often enhances long-term environmental and social sustainability, as in the case of "circular" economic systems that strive to eliminate waste. Through collaboration with global manufacturing firms, a comprehensive protocol has emerged for design of resilient and sustainable systems, along with life cycle-based tools for quantifying the resulting benefits. These methods broaden the system boundary to account for the hidden role of ecosystem services in enterprise operations. For instance, network analysis was used to quantify the contribution of pollination services to economic performance, revealing the indirect dependencies of many industrial sectors on natural pollinators. In another application, climate change scenarios were used in an integrated modeling approach to enable climate-resilient design for two industrial processes-heat exchange and urea manufacturing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Urban last-mile delivery faces great challenges to satisfy growing customer demand with faster, punctual delivery expectations, under tight budgets and environmental requirements. The recently introduced physical internet (PI) offers a conceptual framework to address these challenges, overcoming low efficiency of current fragmented logistics operations with seamless asset sharing and flow consolidation leveraging hyperconnected systems. This article first provides a decision and system architecture for hyperconnected urban logistics, then investigates its potential at a strategic level through a simulation-based experiment in the context of large-item delivery. The results clearly demonstrate the potential of hyperconnected urban logsitics by concurrently improving often opposing measures: economic efficiency, service capability and sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food processing industries confront challenges in dealing with wastewater due to seasonal fluctuations. This can lead to potentially untreated wastewater discharge and regulatory non-compliance. Untreated water can also adversely affect the efficiency of municipal wastewater treatment and the local environment. A mobile rental wastewater treatment service for the food processing industry has been proposed as an innovative solution, simultaneously promoting the Circular Economy through water reuse and material recovery. It enables on-demand and on-site wastewater processing, particularly during peak operation. Moreover, it provides additional services for extracting value-added compounds (e.g., polyphenols), delivering further financial benefits. To assess the sustainability of this new business model, this paper presents a hybrid simulation study using agent-based, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis. The hybrid model is applied to a new mobile wastewater service being trialled in the Peloponnesian region of Greece. By considering factors such as customer composition and the volume of wastewater to be treated, logistics (mobile units and hubs), and staggered investments in capacity boosting, the model supports the commercialisation efforts of the rental business model put forward in the case study. The paper contributes to modelling methodology, especially in the use of hybrid simulation within the context of the circular economy of water; it also contributes to the practice of modelling and simulation by exploring their role in assessing the feasibility of novel business models. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - In the dynamic landscape of technological advancements, the Digital Twin is emerging as a powerful aid with the potential to transform traditional decision-making approaches for diverse complex systems. Technically, it offers a paradigm shift in our understanding and resolution of intricate problems by effectively mirroring real-world entities. This enables us to comprehend their behaviors through simulation, anticipate anomalies for outlier environmental conditions, and derive evidence-driven solutions. While proven effective in physical and cyber-physical systems, its untapped potential lies in the realm of techno-socio-economic systems that operate in dynamic and uncertain environments. The use of such technology in informed decision-making is significant for enterprises and society, as modern businesses and societal structures demand innovative solutions that transcend conventional approaches. With the growing need, the global digital twin market is expected to expand from $11.51 billion in 2023 to $137.67 billion by 2030, impacting domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, sustainability, smart cities, and more. However, realizing this vast business potential hinges on advancing technological capabilities and fostering innovation. This workshop aims to discuss the existing landscape of digital twins and explore uncharted territory by harnessing the latent potential of Digital Twins within techno-socio-economic systems. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Collective self-consumption can have an important role contributing to decarbonization and sustainability goals in cities. However, the implementation of such projects is hindered by technical, economic, social and regulatory barriers, which may compromise those goals. Based on the recent guiding principles for collective energy systems established under the scope of the European Union's Clean Energy Package, this work aims to assess how cost minimization and self-consumption maximization collective objectives may influence the economic and energy performance of a shared electricity generation and self-consumption project implemented in a multi-tenancy environment. A multiagent framework is developed to model the building dynamics while optimization algorithms are implemented to exploit individual and collective goals. Our findings show that cost minimization and self-consumption maximization can be conflicting objectives and influence the project energy and economic performance. While the cost minimization objective is more attractive for projects in which cost-driven participants are concerned with recovering investment, the self-consumption maximization objective is more suitable for cost-indifferent participants and projects aimed at energy self-sufficiency. These results raise relevant hints for stakeholders (participants, investors and policymakers), contributing to make better investment decisions and design better policies incentivizing electricity generation and management in multi-tenancy buildings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The blue economy has become an endogenous driving force behind the sustainable economic growth of all countries. While developing the ocean space sustainably, countries are promoting their economic growth, which is the building block for obtaining economic benefits from the blue economy and promoting blue growth. The development potential of the blue economy in different countries depends not only on the resource endowments they own, but also on the internal- and cross-agent correlation that affects the development of the blue economy. Therefore, this paper qualitatively analyzes this complex system based on a multiagent perspective, proposes a conceptual framework of the national blue economic system, and studies the logical relationships between agents with different attributes and their development mechanism. To provide a scientific policy basis for the systematic and multistandard assessment of the development of a country's blue economy, more interdisciplinary attention is needed and a methodological shift in blue economy studies will be induced in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - City sustainability is a complex system affected by economic, social, and environmental dimensions, with the existence of interaction and conflict among factor. However, there is a lack of real methodology on the measurement of interaction. Then, this article presents a method to calculate the interaction among multiple criteria, including static interaction and dynamic trend similarity, and to compute the weigh coefficient of each indicator induced by this interaction. In addition, the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by evaluating the sustainability performance of 14 cities in Liaoning province China in the context of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. Our results show that the sustainable development of 14 cities in Liaoning province experienced dramatically downward and has a crucial condition from 2013 to 2017. Only Dalian, Shenyang, Panjin, Benxi, and Yingkou could be classified as a Good level (Level Ⅱ), and none of cities was an Excellent level (Level Ⅰ). From spatial-temporal perspective, regional disparities of sustainability are demonstrated by spatial distributions of city sustainability. In detail, the comprehensive sustainability and subsystem exhibit a “cold-spot in West” feature. The scores for indicators reveal that the shortage of science expenditure, declining investment in fixed asset, lack of economic growth, and lagging public transportation are the main limit factor faced by most cities. Meanwhile, tertiary industry development, energy efficiency improvement, increase green coverage, and reduce pollutant emissions are primary driving factors for improving sustainability. Comparing with other methods, MCDM considering interaction among criteria is an appropriate method to evaluate city sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, smart technologies and networking solutions, such as Internet of things (IoT), have been adopted by most leading cities in China as ways to revitalize economic opportunities and strengthen their global resilience to climate change. This paper presents the concept of the smart city, which serves as a complex system by integrating sensors, data, applications, and organizational forms to make cities more agile and sustainable when faced with global climate changes. The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of smart city initiatives in China in recent years. Six key conceptual dimensions of smart city practices are classified: energy, agriculture, transport, buildings, urban services, and urban security operations. Chinese smart city policy and practices explore renewable energy and resources, increase public convenience, and make cities more comfortable and citizen friendly. Critical concerns are explored in such areas as integration (within the urban system, with other cities), governance, innovation, and finance. Finally, a policy vision is outlined to build up public-private collaborative networks, to encourage more innovations and investments in smart city initiatives, and to put more emphasis on smart services. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Cities in many countries are witnessing an era of transformative innovations in vehicular technologies and mobility-on-demand (MoD) services in the context of global initiatives of smart and connected cities. However, advances in the built environment where vehicles operate have not maintained the same pace. The new MoD especially burdens curb environments in urban cores due to competition for spaces for pick-ups and drop-offs (PUDO). These uncoordinated and diverse uses without data-driven management have led to increased safety and sustainability issues. This research intends to address the increasing curbside uses of PUDO activities due to MoD services and proposes a data-driven agent-based simulation approach to plan designated PUDO zones in limited public curbside spaces. A case study was conducted for five street blocks in urban cores of the City of Gainesville, Florida, United States, based on longitudinal parking transaction and violation records, place visitation data, and geospatial data of parking assets. The results show that temporary PUDO zones should be designated at all investigated blocks during peak hours even when the MoD market penetration rate is low (i.e., 10%), which helps mitigate the occurrences of competing use events, while permanent PUDO zones should be designated for the two busiest blocks when the MoD market penetration rates increase to 30% or 50%. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the designated PUDO zones can mitigate curbside stresses more effectively when regulating MoD users' PUDO dwell time (e.g., within one minute). This research aims to contribute to data-driven public asset managerial decision-making and strategies in smart cities and benefits more accessible and sustainable living environments in urban cores.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This book will satisfy the demand among college majors in Finance and Financial Engineering, and mathematically-versed practitioners for description of both the classical approaches to equity investing and new investment strategies scattered in the periodic literature. Besides the major portfolio management theories (mean variance theory, CAPM, and APT), the book addresses several important topics: portfolio diversification, optimal ESG portfolios, factor models (smart betas), robust portfolio optimization, risk-based asset allocation, statistical arbitrage, alternative data based investing, back-testing of trading strategies, modern market microstructure, algorithmic trading, and agent-based modeling of financial markets. The book also includes the basic elements of time series analysis in the Appendix for self-contained presentation of the material. While the book covers technical concepts and models, it will not overburden the reader with math beyond the Finance undergraduates' curriculum. © 2022 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable systems must be complex systems. For simple systems, namely those designed for (“optimal”) “equilibrium” pipe dreams, even if in dynamic and stochastic versions, the sustainability issue is meaningless. And complex systems, we will show, need political-economic analysis as well as properly framed complex and adaptive policies to be shaped, structured, organized, institutionally governed, regulated, and managed to become sustainable on a “good” path. We highlight a few examples of complex thinking from ancient times to the present.4 They illustrate that simple (neoclassical) equilibrium thinking is an extreme special case rather than the “normal” in the HET and that “heterodox” (complex and evolutionary) political economy is the way of doing relevant, real-world economics. Much of the HET has included considerations of making embedded socio-(ecological-)economic systems sustainable, both in themselves and in their factual broader (social and natural) environments, through proper framing, structuring, institutional governance, and political regulation. We further illustrate the potential of such “political economy” with an example from evolutionary-institutional economics and its policy implications. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Arturo Hermann; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Purpose: The authors discuss how artificial intelligence (AI) can facilitate and incentivize reform in corporate social responsibility (CSR), i.e. governance with regard to pledge for socially responsible investments (SRIs). Design/methodology/approach: The current essay examines the impacts of AI systems on the dynamics between corporate governance and financial markets in terms of promoting sustainability. Based on a qualitative review of over 100 pieces of literature, we offer an outlook into the mentioned dynamics through the lens of complex systems. Legal and ethical provisions for safe and robust AI systems are briefly discussed and integrated. Findings: In a closed system, there is a reinforcing feedback loop between SRI and CSR. AI is a moderator to increase SRI and a mediator to incentivize CSR. If the legal and ethical provisions are involved in the AI systems, they could act as catalyst for corporate governance reform towards sustainability.

AB  - Intelligent agriculture has the potential of increasing sustainability and productivity in the field of agriculture and livestock, through efficient and precise use of resources. Thus, this technology gives the possibility of promoting growth in developing countries through automation and control of repetitive farming activities, such as monitoring the level of water and feed in the feeders, which allows farmers to save time. However, the implementation of an automatic feed and water level control system in a livestock enclosure requires a large investment in silo scales, which may be too expensive for an SME. Thanks to the evolution of IoT devices, it is possible to reduce the cost of this implementation while integrating new functionalities and interactions through the interconnection of devices with cloud solutions. This work presents a new system that allows to monitor the quantity and quality of food and water in a silo by estimating volume in real time. Moreover, it has an additional functionality; temperature and humidity estimation in a livestock enclosure. The hardware system will be managed by a multi-agent system in charge of the processes of managing the data, managing the quantity of food and water supplied to each feeder. The use of a multi-agent architecture allows for the development of a distributed solution that provides great possibilities for future analysis, for example through a massive data analysis. The case study results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, it has provided the ideal amount of feed and water to the animals, controlling the quality of grain and water, reducing the number of colics caused by overfeeding. In addition, the time the farmer must spend on the farm reduces considerably. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Worldwide, many developing countries are making efforts to achieve sustainability through the 17 SDGs and at the same time to contribute to environmental security. The Nexus approach enables a more integrated and sustainable use of resources that extends beyond traditional siloed thinking and is applicable at multiple scales. This is especially important in a globalized world where collaboration is becoming increasingly important for societies. In this framework, we present an analysis that will assist policymakers set priorities in investments by investigating the influence of the WEF nexus on the 17 SDGs and vice versa. Following the Nexus approach may thus enhance synergies and contribute to increased performance in connected SDGs that are positively influenced. In this article, we present an analysis that allows stakeholders to adapt it to their specific needs by entering new scores based on the characteristics of each case study; the results of this methodology should be considered in light of the specific conditions, including socio-cultural aspects and geographical, geopolitical, and governance realities, as well as the scale of the case study in question. A Fuzzy Cognitive Map analysis is also conducted on the scores to quantify SDG impact and identify the SDGs that most strongly “influence” nexus-coherent policies and the SDGs that are most strongly “influenced by” the nexus. This is achieved by analyzing the causality in this complex system of positive and negative interlinkages. Through this analysis, three SDGs, namely SDG 2 (Food), SDG 6 (Water) and SDG 7 (Energy), are indicated as the most influenced by the WEF nexus, revealing either synergies or trade-offs, while other SDGs are identified as having little interaction with the WEF nexus system. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Construction assets are complex systems that require the analysis of a huge amount of data from materials and processes in order to perform a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Information from construction products and materials are usually provided with Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which will be incorporated in LCA or Building Information Modelling (BIM) software for sustainability assessment purposes. This research studied digital EPDs available from Programme Operators, in order to identify the limitations for an automatic computer transfer of EPD-data into software tools without previous human interpretation of the content. Several implemented solutions were analysed, such as the international standard EN ISO 22057, the ILCD+EPD format, IFC or Smart CE. The research includes the evaluation of the scientific literature and the ISO, IEC and CEN/CENELEC standards related to sustainability assessment of buildings and infrastructures, EPDs or BIM. The study identifies limitations for computer-interpretability of digital EPDs, such as the definition of scenarios and the unique identification of the elements and performance characteristics. The discussion and conclusions assess the identified limitations and provide some preliminary solutions for future research. The results can be applied to other construction product-related data and/or to EPD or LCA data from other sectors. The significance of this research relies on bridging the gap between digital EPDs and BIM, reducing the cost and time required for the LCA of built assets, supporting the application of science-based policies and the measurement of ESG indicators used by public and private organisations in relation to buildings and infrastructures. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The Supply Chain Finance Ecosystem Model is different from the traditional supply chain construction concept that starts with enterprises. It emphasizes focusing on industries and cities, integrating regional markets and industry supply interests at all levels. It incorporates green environmental factors, excess capacity warning, and withdrawal concepts into the design of the industrial supply chain model. In this study, it designed the theory of energy efficiency in the industrial green operation network and the Online-to-Offline (O2O) system model, proposed the flexible coverage and control theory of the industrial green operation network, the theory of priority transmission of excess capacity, and elastic access methods. The studies can be used as a reference for the design of platform algorithms. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Urban mobility is currently undergoing three fundamental transformations with the sharing economy, electrification, and autonomous vehicles changing how people and goods move across cities. In this paper, we demonstrate the valuable contribution of decision support systems that combine data-driven analytics and simulation techniques in understanding complex systems such as urban transportation. Using the city of Berlin as a case study, we show that shared, autonomous electric vehicles can substantially reduce resource investments while keeping service levels stable. Our findings inform stakeholders on the trade-off between economic and sustainability-related considerations when fostering the transition to sustainable urban mobility. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - With increasing realised traffic on transport networks, greenhouse gas emissions show a similar trend. Reducing them is a modern aspiration, creating a better place to live and moving towards sustainability. Expanding the infrastructure is often not an appropriate solution, as the system would only be fully utilised at peak times, while at less frequent times it would not even approach capacity and would require huge investment costs. An alternative to further construction work is the implementation of intelligent traffic systems, where smoother flows can achieve higher capacity by reducing the variability in the system. In a motorway environment, a common approach is Variable Speed Limit Control, where the road is divided into zones and individual speed limits are used to increase or decrease the load on the cells. This paper proposes a solution in which individual cells make decisions cooperatively, in contrast to classical state machine-based methods. Thanks to the jointly formulated goal of the agents, a predictive control method is created that leads to a reduction in emissions due to avoided shock waves and reduced waiting times. This paper presents a solution that provides a universal solution across multiple application lengths, illustrating the power of deep learning. https://github.com/istvan-knab/Variable-speed-limit-control.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Now for past many decades, automotive manufacturing is under perennial pressure owing to consumer aspirations, regulations, globalized competition and sustainability needs. Automotive manufactures are fiercely satisfying all of above constraints through innovative solutions. The resultant vehicles have many complex to very complex systems and subsystems to deliver the performance aspirations. In this game, one of the critical business parameter is rapid time to market. At the current state of the art, time to market directly conflicts with new product development time. Four wheeler new product development consumes upward of 48 months, while risking obsolescence of product features at the time of launch. Automotive manufacturers invest intensely in technologies to achieve this goal of short time to market. Digital technologies delivering high time efficiency have made deep in roads in the automotive product development arena. However yet physical validation is an inevitable step to get vehicle ready for launch. Meaningful validations require functional prototypes. Products being complex in nature, significant lead-time and investments are consumed in prototyping. Conventional part or tool manufacturing works as counterproductive for cost as well as time needs. Hence one more time shortening technique is to build functional prototype for a fixed purpose (validation intent). Built for purpose prototypes deliver extremely high time efficiency, but demand highly skilled prototype manufacturing engineers and technicians. Such rare teams work innovatively combining art and science to compress time lines. This technical paper focuses on smart use of quick manufacturing processes inclusive but not restricting to AM for advancing the product development. The achievement lies in using AM along with allied technologies to achieve the desired fit for purpose functional prototype rapidly. Innovated method would also yield a cost advantage as against the standard prototyping/manufacturing processes. Paper would also discuss on the possibilities of takes these learning for mass manufacturing. © 2023 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - From a public finance point of view, achieving sustainable development hinges on two critical factors: the subnational implementation of public policies and the efficient allocation of resources across regions through vertical intergovernmental transfers. We introduce a framework that links these two mechanisms for analyzing the impact of reallocating federal transfers in the presence of regional heterogeneity from development indicators, budget sizes, expenditure returns, and long-term structural factors. Our study focuses on the case of Mexico and its 32 states. Using an agent-based computational model, we estimate the development gaps that will remain by the year 2030, and characterize their sensitivity to changes in the states’ budget sizes. Then, we estimate the optimal distribution of federal transfers to minimize these gaps. Crucially, these distributions depend on the specific development objectives set by the national government, and by various interdependencies between the heterogeneous qualities of the states. This work sheds new light on the complex problem of budgeting for the Sustainable Development Goals at the subnational level, and it is especially relevant for the study of fiscal decentralization from the expenditure point of view. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - South Africa’s land redistribution aims to redress the historical injustices of apartheid. This paper evaluates the efficacy of an agent-based model to support and refine the process. Using the Impacts of Land Use Patterns in South Africa model, developed from surveys of 658 commercial farmers and 833 commercially oriented smallholders, we simulate three scenarios: the current willing seller, willing buyer mechanism as our baseline, a second scenario that includes land subdivision to produce emerging farm parcels, and a third scenario that includes expropriation of underperforming farms. We find that the current mechanism is likely to redistribute only 14% of the targeted 30% of commercial farmland. Including land subdivision increases the number of beneficiary farms from 4,383 to 73,600, improving access to land but reducing farm sizes and thus possibly economic sustainability. Including expropriation adds about 2.4 million hectares, mainly for grazing, with a small allocation for field crops and horticulture. All three scenarios could reduce production volumes, with marked differences in impact across agricultural subsectors in the subdivision scenario. Realising these scenarios over an eight-year period is projected to require substantial financial investment, with estimated costs ranging from R422 billion to R626.9 billion, heavily weighted towards operational capital to maintain farm productivity and viability. The study demonstrates the model’s value for policymakers, enabling them to explore and evaluate the outcomes of different land redistribution strategies, ensuring more informed and effective policy-making. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper a ready-to-use software component, which simulates real state of rice crop in the field and called 'Digital Twin of rice' (DT), is studied. DT uses ontology-based knowledge base of plant cultivation to execute the rules of plant growth. The software provides real-time data collection from the fields and distributed decision making to find the optimum solution in planning process of rice growth stages. Rice DT is developed as an autonomous service and can be integrated to any existing digital agricultural platform. A pilot integration with cyber-physical system (CPS) for precise farming is described in the paper. The CPS has a number of services to provide digital transformation in plant cultivation enterprises and big farms. The system performs adaptive scheduling of resources, such as fertilizers, protection agents, vehicles, personnel and finance. Results of DT implementation shows adequate decision-making of the service compared to experiments on the pilot farms. So, DT of plant could be a next step in digital transformation of agriculture, providing improvement of ROI from precision farming, automate decision-making processes for farmers and service companies and make their business smarter, more flexible, and more cost-efficient, providing better productivity of plant cultivation and sustainability of agriculture under global climate changes. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The energy sustainability of blockchains, whose consensus protocol rests on the Proof-of-Work, nourishes a heated debate. The underlying issue lies in a highly energy-consuming process, defined as mining, required to validate crypto-asset transactions. Mining is the process of solving a cryptographic puzzle, incentivized by the possibility of gaining a reward. The higher the number of users performing mining, i.e. miners, the higher the overall electricity consumption of a blockchain. For that reason, mining constitutes a negative environmental externality. Here, we study whether miners' interests can meet the collective need to curb energy consumption. To this end, we introduce the Crypto-Asset Game, namely a model based on the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory devised for studying the dynamics of a population whose agents can play as crypto-asset users or as miners. The proposed model, studied via numerical simulations, reveals a rich spectrum of possible steady states. Interestingly, by setting the miners' reward in the function of the population size, agents reach a strategy profile that optimizes global energy consumption. To conclude, can a Proof-of-Work-based blockchain become energetically sustainable? Our results suggest that blockchain protocol parameters could have a relevant role in the global energy consumption of this technology.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Thousands of years of progress in urban development led to complex urban environments that can be considered as complex systems. The management of complex systems must account for uncertainty, unpredictable future states and nonlinear behaviour. In this context, digitalisation can play a key role in the development of innovative tools to support strategic decisions and emergency management. In particular, the management of university building stocks can be facilitated with the creation of digital environments. In the Italian case, university campuses are often complex assets composed of widespread buildings and the management process is still based on fragmented databases handled by different administrative divisions resulting in a lack of information among stakeholders. The integration between Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS) is already making some steps towards the creation of a digital model of the city. The combination of BIM-GIS with a platform for the data management is the base to develop an Asset Management System to exploit Business Intelligence (BI) tools for Operation and Maintenance (O&M) in smart campuses. This research aims to integrate BIM, GIS and BI tools in a digital framework for the development of an AMS and web-based application for the improvement of the experience among users and the optimal use of resources. A real case study is proposed for the development of the research project, namely the University of Turin building stock, in Italy. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Over recent years, the sustainability and resilience concept has increased its significance in the construction industry. Sustainability is associated with implementing best practices in the construction industry, while resilience is the adaptability and tolerance of systems in harsh conditions. The concepts are learned in the construction process. Moreover, building automation is growing rapidly, and buildings are becoming increasingly dependent on complex systems and technology and susceptible to unanticipated failure. Though sustainability and resilience concepts are interlinked, limited research quantifies their combination, resulting in a limited comprehension of how both concepts interact during application by developers in a smart building. Therefore, this study has established a financial model that employs Net Present Value (NPV) in studying the inference and clampdown of investment in both concepts. NPV was estimated using indirect and direct costs and benefits derived from the continuous integration of sustainability and resilience in a smart building. To quantify sustainability, its three components had to be quantified. Reduced energy expenditure and government environmental incentives were used to calculate the environmental component. Workers’ cost savings, fire insurance cost savings, and additional system maintenance costs were used to calculate the economic component. The social component of sustainability measured hard-to-quantify attributes like productivity, indoor environment quality, reputation, extra profit, services, and safety. To quantify them, a survey and RII method were used. The two concepts were then coupled by estimating the benefits and costs of installing and keeping resilience tools in design that are sustainable in the smart building and the impact study on the NPV outcome. Application of the design model was also carried out on four smart buildings that were selected in Dubai. The result indicated that coupling sustainable approaches and resilience yields higher NPV by at least 22%. Nevertheless, for NPV to be maintained positively and reduce the cost of failure, faulty detection tools should be assimilated while designing sustainable and smart buildings. The findings of this study will contribute to the benefit of other researchers, developers, investors, managers, engineers, and anyone who is involved in the design or construction process of intelligent buildings. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Distribution of goods affects city congestion and air pollution; it also increases costs and reduces quality of life. City logistics are aimed at reducing the negative effects of distribution while supporting city development. Over the past two decades, many city logistics initiatives have failed in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. As many actors and stakeholders are involved in the complex organizational process of city logistics, it is important to investigate and understand the causes of these failures. This is the purpose of this article, which considers Italian experiences of city logistics. Evaluation of city logistics initiatives is necessary to ensure success in future implementation, to achieve sustainable urban freight transport development. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been applied to evaluate different fields, such as supply chain, stock market, freight distribution, and traffic management. We conducted a review on city logistics projects in the main Italian cities with experience in these initiatives, in particular, in the case of failure. Our analysis considered the MAS, which utilizes multiple stakeholders’ points of view with different effects to improve city logistics feasibility. The study considers Italian experiences in city logistics, but other countries may have different backgrounds and different situations. Therefore, predictions may be valid only for Italy and not in other contexts. Our perspective is quite original compared with the existing literature as it focuses on the failures of city logistics projects rather than best practices. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - This chapter approaches sustainability as an emergent holistic property of hard, soft, or hybrid systems including large and often complex system of systems. In the concept of sustainable systems within the realm of Gaia, such attributes should include energy, natural resources and ecosystem dependencies, environmental stability, technology safety and security and dependability, biodiversity, resource cycling, human-nature interactive complexity and biogeochemical cycles. A large and complex system of systems can possess a wide range of sustainability qualities at macro level. The systems framework is developed and represented in weighted factors analysis methodology (WeFA). The macro concept of a sustainable system is qualitatively assessed for the sustainability of macro systems, such as global economic system, environmental system, transportation system, information system, agriculture system, energy and global climate system. The chapter focuses on investing in network security that should always seek to move the organization nearer to securing the entire network. © 2015 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

AB  - There is an urgent need for policies to close the existing financing gap for civil infrastructure. However, identification of the desired scenarios for the closure of the financing gap is complex because there are many factors that affect investment in infrastructure. Thus, comprehensive models are required to (1) simulate the impacts of policies, and (2) identify the highly likely scenarios for desired policy outcomes. The objective of this paper is to create a simulation model for ex-ante analysis of financing policies in highway transportation infrastructure in the United States. Using the agent-based technique, this model simulates the microbehaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Using the output of the simulation model, financing landscapes of the U.S. transportation infrastructure are developed. The simulated landscape is shown to be helpful in identifying the highly likely scenarios leading to a high level of investment in highway transportation infrastructure under the existing infrastructure investment structures and budget constraints in the United States. The study presented in this paper is novel with respect to (1) the application of the system-of-systems modeling in the analysis of transportation infrastructure financing policies, (2) identification of the desired policy scenarios and their likelihoods for closure of the financing gap in the presence of uncertainties and adaptive behaviors, and (3) simulation and visualization of the impacts of financing policies at the state and national levels. The model promotes a data-driven policy analysis and provides policymakers with a tool to simultaneously account for the impacts of several factors and uncertainties. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The studies performed have created a basis for formation of a new research area — Economics of Quality. Its tools allow to use opportunities of model simulation for construction of the mathematical models adequately reflecting the role of quality in natural, technical, social regularities of functioning of the complex socioeconomic systems. Extensive application and development of models, and also system modeling with use of supercomputer technologies, on our deep belief, will bring the conducted researches of social and economic systems to essentially new level. Moreover, the current scientific research makes a significant contribution to model simulation of multi-agent social systems and that isn’t less important, it belongs to the priority areas in development of science and technology in our country. This article is devoted to the questions of supercomputer technologies application in public sciences, first of all, — regarding technical realization of the large-scale agent-focused models (AFM). The essence of this tool is that owing to increase in power of computers it became possible to describe the behavior of many separate fragments of a difficult system, as social and economic systems represent. The article also deals with the experience of foreign scientists and practicians in launching the AFM on supercomputers, and also the example of AFM developed in CEMI RAS, stages and methods of effective calculating kernel display of multi-agent system on architecture of a modern supercomputer will be analyzed. The experiments on the basis of model simulation on forecasting the population of St. Petersburg according to three scenarios as one of the major factors influencing the development of social and economic system and quality of life of the population are presented in the conclusion. © Okrepilov V.

AB  - The revolution in social scientific theory and practice known as nonlinear dynamics, chaos, or complexity, derived from recent advances in the physical, biological, and cognitive sciences, is now culminating with the widespread use of tools and concepts such as praxis, fuzzy logic, artificial intelligence, and parallel processing. By tracing a number of conceptual threads from mathematics, economics, cybernetics, and various other applied systems theoretics, this book offers a historical framework for how these ideas are transforming the social sciences. Daneke goes on to address a variety of persistent philosophical issues surrounding this paradigm shift, ranging from the nature of human rationality to free will. Finally, he describes this shift as a path for revitalizing the social sciences just when they will be most needed to address the human condition in the new millennium. Systemic Choices describes how praxis and other complex systems tools can be applied to a number of pressing policy and management problems. For example, simulations can be used to grow a number of robust hybrid industrial and/or technological strategies between cooperation and competition. Likewise, elements of international agreements could be tested for sustainability under adaptively evolving institutional designs. Other concrete applications include strategic management, total quality management, and operational analyses. This exploration of a wide range of technical tools and concepts will interest economists, political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, and those in the management disciplines such as strategy, organizational behavior, finance, and operations.

AB  - To better understand how we can improve urban sustainability we need to focus our predictive efforts at the grassroots level of individual inhabitants. To this end we propose a multi agent simulation platform. In describing each element of this platform we review research advances in modelling occupants' presence, activities, behaviours, comfort and investments; suggesting also where further research is required. Our motive here is not to be prescriptive, but simply to start a debate and the process of achieving consensus so that research and development efforts are targeted in a common direction.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the effects on the economy of a feed-in tariff policy mechanism aimed to foster investments in renewable energy production capacity. To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The references that United Nations New Urban Agenda (UN HABITAT, 2015 and 2016, 2017) draw to the attention of disciplinary debate could represent a strong innovation for urban governance instruments and procedures. Especially in this period when European cities are defining the operational framework of development strategies 2014–2020 within the complex system of programming and management of European resources. Tools that the New Cohesion Policy proposes for the definition of local urban agendas are based on a procedural innovation that makes cities protagonists in a complex process of resources planning and managing (huge but never sufficient) for the regeneration and development of cities. In this work we propose an evaluation of the ITI of the Municipality of Potenza, approved in 2017, as it represents an approach that looks at strategic visions of urban development born in a context of fragility of local government and financial contingency for the municipal finances. A representative situation of a large number of medium-sized cities that are called upon to perform functions of ‘Managing Authority’ within the management of resources of Regional Operational Programmes without a structured process of technical/administrative ‘empowerment’ that defines skills, functions and scenarios of sustainability within an urban planning careful to the three principles: equity, efficiency, conservation of resources. In the proposed case study, a framework of isolated interventions emerges which implement parts of a strategy consistent with the guidelines of the urban planning instrument and which require an integrated vision of the main priority intervention areas of local context (mobility, urban parks, historical-cultural resources, services to citizens). © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Agent based approach to model the behavior of a supply chain has proven to be effective and practical. It also satisfies the performance measurement requirements of the supply chain actors. In palm oil supply chain (POSC) operational risk, investment and technology levels between actors may not be proportionately rewarded at the same levels of added-value. Each actor will attempt to obtain the highest reward. However, each actor must consider the level of added-value obtained by other actors so as to maintain fair balance in the overall supply chain profitability. Otherwise the least profitable actor will withdraw itself from the supply chain and it will collapse. In this chapter the authors propose a formula to calculate the utility-function based added-value for each of the actors in the POSC. To optimize added-value distribution and negotiation between agents, the concept of stakeholder dialogue was used. Netlogo software was used in developing the models. This chapter is important because developed models offer a workable algorithm to seek optimum weight level of underlying factors while calculating utility added-value that satisfy POSC as a whole, therefore ensuring the supply chain sustainability. Application of these models to other types of commodity and different supply chain models will need some adjustments in the calculation. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The multiple dynamics of global challenges such as population growth intertwining with land use changes, urbanization, and food security are helping to shape and determine the state of food security challenges. The global population is about 6.8 billion, and it is projected that by 2025, it will reach about 8 billion. Most of the bulk of the additional population is expecting to come from the developing world, which will see its population increase by 61 percent by 2050. World population is growing at an exponential rate and people, be they in urban or rural areas, depend on food for everyday sustenance (UN-ESA, 2009). Population densities of Cameroon stand at 62.6, which are relatively high and are on the increase (World Bank, 2013). Food availability is an important factor affecting human population growth, along with other density dependent limiting factors (Hopfenberg, 2003). The increasing population will therefore have a significant role in influencing and shaping the nature of change and future of land use and food security. ‘Hunger has always been an invitation to make a better world, and it remains so’ (Roberts, 2008). Throughout the history of human existence, food has held centre stage in the construction of human societies and the evolution of human activity. Food is vital to our understanding of who we are as nations and communities, and the healthy production of food beyond subsistence levels (Budge and Slade, 2009) is a call for attention. This opens up avenues for deeper assessments on linking exponential growth rates in population and food security needs, which may lead to even more transformations of landscapes, land use, land cover, development or shocks within societies. By this, greater concerns over issues of population, land use change, urbanization, climate change, and food security will remain top on the international agenda on global challenges (FAO, 2005). Population growth influences land use patterns in combination with consump- tion behaviours and productive activities of the world’s people (Wolman, 1993). Current population growth is being accompanied by a change in human habitat. Population growth, migration, family formation, and household fission lead to greater population density and land fragmentation. This growth and density leads to increased consumption of natural resources through the expansion of grazing and fodder, as well as in increased agricultural production (intensification and extensification on marginal lands) (Mortimore et al., 1994). Understanding trends in population size and change are crucial to estimating the future demand for food (Godfray et al., 2010). Examining and understanding the systemic of present and future human population distribution is critical to understanding the impacts that population growth could have on the rest of the human-environment system in the future. The introduction of satellite image systems presses a new paradigm shift to the forefront of spatial demographic analysis. Satellite data can now be used along with more traditional demographic techniques, providing an even better tool for evaluating population dynamics. It has become one of the strongest tools for analysing and interpreting the complex systems of the earth and the anthropogenic influences that continue to pressure the planet’s limited resources. This of course must be taken in the context of inherent data errors and all other problems and assumptions associated with extrapolation from one scale to another (Muhlestein, 2008). This chapter thus questions how population dynamics affects the sustainability of agricultural land use and also the vulnerability of land users’ in being food secure. It seeks to establish a link between land use land cover change and population change dynamics in determining food security. © 2016 Rob Roggema, selection and editorial material; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Public infrastructure is an interdependent system of actors, organisations, assets, services, the society it serves, and the context of each and their whole. This complexity presents research challenges for those focused at the system level, not the least that there is limited research in whole-of-system working for public infrastructure administration and the public sector more generally. Although the available literature appears unified in calling for a probing, pluralist approach, there are few examples of how to approach complex systems in practice. This paper derives from a research programme on the strategic intent and management of infrastructure systems. That programme used the New Zealand land transport system as its focus; nonetheless, it should have wider application given the shared issues being faced within infrastructure practice and matters of sustainability, resilience and system fitness more generally. By melding methods, the action research methodology is aimed at assisting researchers of complex systems and/or problems in gaining more fulsome insights and evidence to support theory. Accordingly, the methodology contributes to the understanding of how to approach infrastructure systems from a research perspective. It offers a road map, a means of sense-making and socialising the issues found at the whole-of-system level and a systemic diagnostic tool. © 2019 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.

AB  - Agriculture is a complex system in which the economic principles of production are directly intertwined with its biological and ecological characteristics. The paper investigates synergetic potentials of multiple-criteria and multiple-perspective evaluation of agricultural activity through a study of the dairy sector in Slovenia. Socio-economic and emergy evaluation was performed on nine farm types, formulated to represent the diversity of the country's dairy sector. The results indicate larger discrepancies in the performance of the farm types when defined by socio-economic or emergy based indicators. Standard socio-economic evaluation favours larger conventional systems that are cost efficient and financially independent. Emergy analysis however, favours less productive organic farms, which show greater ability to exploit free local resources and produce less stress on the local environment. Socio-economic and emergy indicators show that small conventional farm types are the poorest performers overall. Analysis of emergy flows reveals for all farm types a high dependency on the wider socio-economic system, suggesting that within the current economic system agriculture itself has little ability to affect its sustainability. The paper suggests a complementarity in the evaluation approaches. Their joint application can improve the quality of the decision-making process in various stages of planning in agriculture and land use. © 2014.

AB  - The ultimate goal of the FuturICT Flagship is to understand and manage complex, global, socially interactive systems, with a focus on sustainability and resilience. Revealing the hidden laws and processes underlying societies constitutes the most pressing scientific grand challenge of our century. Integrating the three components of ICT, Complexity Science and the Social Sciences will lead to a paradigm shift, facilitating a symbiotic co-evolution of ICT and society. Data from our complex globe-spanning ICT system will be leveraged to develop models of techno-socio-economic systems. In turn, insight from these models will inform the development of a new generation of socially adaptive, self-organised ICT systems. FuturICT as a whole will act as a Knowledge Accelerator, turning massive data into knowledge and technological progress. FuturICT will create the scientific methods and ICT platforms needed to address planetary-scale challenges and opportunities in the 21st century. Specifically, FuturICT will build a sophisticated simulation, visualization and participation platform, known as the Living Earth Simulator. This platform will power Observatories, to detect and mitigate crises, and Participatory Platforms, to support decision-making for policy-makers and citizens. In the Coordination Action Pilot Study which is running from May 2011-April 2012, activities will take place to develop the scientific vision and roadmap, secure stakeholder commitment, establish the FuturICT legal and operational infrastructure, and build on our remarkable success in uniting previously fragmented research communities. The main aim of the activities throughout the project will be to refine the FuturICT vision and identify measureable milestones along the way. This will produce an ambitious large-scale, science-driven, visionary research initiative to promote and develop future research outcomes in ICT. Through these activities, the Coordination Action will allow Europe to grasp this unique opportunity for groundbreaking progress in science and ICT, with great impacts for society, governance and industry by launching the FuturICT Flagship in 2013. © Selection and peer-review under responsibility of FET11 conference organizers and published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainability is becoming more and more the key challenge for organisations. Sustainability depends on internal and external characteristics of the organisation that should or must be preserved within the time and depends on the definition of what is a suitable state of the system (organisation and its environment) within medium and long terms as safety can be seen as feature of sustainability. The concept of sustainability is a key concept for safety researchers and practitioners. The reverse is true as safety concepts are useful to think sustainability which is still rather new. They share common research grounds on management and organisations sciences. In France, as exemplary organisations, public organisations are working on issues related to both the assessment and governance of sustainability. In this paper we propose a "proactive-based assessment" designed to measure an organisation's ability to govern and achieve sustainability. The proposed assessment method relies on three new concepts: "critical capital" ; Highly Sustainable Organisation (HSO), and learning stages within an HSO.Although there are some elements of unpredictability in complex systems, sustainability for an organisation is based at least on its ability to learn and adapt. There are different ways of conceiving sustainability for public organisations. Even though there is no consensus on the way public organisations are conceived, there is still a philosophical and political agreement on the need for more sustainability. However, it is still unclear and sometimes not even pointed "what should be sustained for public organisations?". We suggest that the "critical capital" is characterised by internal and external aspects of the organisation that should be preserved within the time such as (i) the way of functioning of the organisation, (ii) the way the missions are performed or exercised by the organisation to meet what is contextually referred as being of public and common needs and (iii) the "organisational memory" that represents the identity of the public organisation and the assets of the public organisation. The term "Capital" does not refer to its definition in economy but to its given definitions in sociology (see for example Ferragina, 2010) and ecology (see for example Jansson, 1994). Criticality is fixed "according to the way public service is conceived, to the contextual constraints (such as economical, environmental, social, cultural and ethical) and according to the degree and the nature of threats (natural and manmade hazards).We suggest that organisational sustainability is the ability of the system to preserve and to maintain, within the time, a critical capital and to adapt to its ecosystem. Accordingly, a loss of organisational sustainability indicate whether the organisation is prone to shift to an undesirable organisational state that would decrease the ability or even cease to provide services to the ecosystem and to maintain its identity. In other words, it is an organisation that loses part of its critical capital. Accordingly, we have proposed a development stage model to make explicit the way we have observed in these organisations a common progression in the initiatives they have taken to address sustainability challenges and build learning and innovation capabilities. The three concepts arise from a four years investigation and observation of more than 60 public organisations in France and the coordination, at a national level, of the French working group on "governance of public organisations" that end up with the publication of four national guidelines in March 2013. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This chapter presents an agent-based model of household investments in high-cost, environmentally friendly technologies. Our model considers how the dynamics of adoption over time are sensitive to the strategies of firms that market these technologies. Our model shows that when firms systematically target potential adopters with a high baseline propensity for adoption, a trade-off is created between two evaluative criteria of interest to policymakers: the overall speed of technology adoption and the equity of access to these technologies between rich and poor communities. This model provides a tool for planners to diagnose the potential equity concerns that may arise from strategies that firms use to maximize their short-term interests. Models such as this enable us to evaluate strategies to simultaneously promote widespread adoption as well as equitable access to technologies that promote human well-being and the sustainable use of natural resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In the context of sustainable development, complex adaptive systems frameworks can help address the coupling of macro social, environmental and economic constraint and opportunity with individual agency. Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from human and nature dynamics (HANDY) theory with Prisoner’s Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then create a new human and nature dynamics agent based model to explore technological progression on population dynamics, economic development, social inequality and use of resources. We investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and societal sustainability. Our initial result shows complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all scales of human behavior and dynamics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.

AB  - Over time, design instructors have become more encouraged to accommodate the play metaphor in their courses, for its rich technical and psychological assets. While there are issues regarding the interactive narrative structure of the game, embodied Multi-Agent-Systems (MAS) have been introduced to address these issues and handle complicated game objectives. With the ever-growing complexity of design concepts and the mounting demand to design for sustainability, more variables and intricacies are introduced to the design and decision making process. This paper presents a proposed method that utilizes MAS in game engines to resolve the environment design complexity for design students and untrained professionals. This method offers better comprehension of the implication of data generated from building analysis tools, and presents guidelines to develop the proposed design accordingly. © 2004, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

AB  - As the science enterprise becomes increasingly complex and interdisciplinary, implementing policies that foster collective creativity for science-based innovation emerges as a critical issue. In this paper, we introduce a general-purpose model to study dynamic processes of collective creativity in scientific communities. An exploratory study based on agent simulation is conducted to better understand how innovation capacity and sustainability of the innovation ecosystem relate to interaction topologies, culture and resource allocation strategies. Experimental results indicate that communities, by building highly connected clusters under low to moderate resource availability, can produce epistemic cultures with high degrees of sustainability. Additionally, priority-based investment coupled with technology transferring improves diversity within the science-based innovation ecosystem. Copyright © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This article interprets the natural laws creating and maintaining a complex system, such as an ecology or an economy, distant from equilibrium, as computations on a real world Universal Turing Machine (UTM). As a laboratory, UTM can simulate the real world UTM, from the perspective of algorithmic information theory, the number of bits in the shortest, appropriately coded binary algorithm that specifies a real world system on a laboratory UTM defines its algorithmic entropy and its information content. As only algorithmic entropy differences matter, and differences are UTM-independent, differences measured on the laboratory UTM align with entropy changes in the real world. The system's distance from equilibrium in bits defines its order. Computations require energy. Landauer's principle identifies the minimum energy per bit (or the real world equivalent) to drive the computation that creates and sustains a real world system in a homeostatic state distant from equilibrium. This high-grade energy carries the computational instructions that do work on the system, ejecting disorder as heat and waste. While replication algorithms drive the emergence of complex ecological systems (doi:10.1016/j.biosystems.2015.11.008), in economic systems, individual agent behaviour can be captured by computer algorithms akin to the perspective of an adaptive system paradigm. Rather than specifying detailed behavioural routines for an economy, a narrative is used to identify the information drivers that create an ordered far-from-equilibrium economic system. The narrative shows that, somewhat like the interdependence of species in a vibrant ecology, agents trade, utilise technology, and amalgamate to form more complex structures creating order and driving the economy further from equilibrium. An ordered economy is a better economy. Order-creating investments (infrastructure, machines etc.) enhance economic performance, in contrast to non-ordering investments that extract wealth from others, adding nothing. © 2017 WIT Press.

AB  - According to the National Academy of Engineering, innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, alternative fuels, and smart grids are critical to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of infrastructure systems. One key to realizing infrastructure innovations is effective policymaking based on a comprehensive analysis of the system. However, policy analysis in infrastructure systems is difficult because of the existence of complex adaptive behaviors and uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to create an ex-ante analysis framework using Agent-Based simulation to facilitate incorporation of uncertainties and complex adaptive behaviors of stakeholders in the analysis of infrastructure policies. The proposed framework includes three phases: definition, abstraction, and implementation. First, the steps in each phase will be discussed. Then, the application of the framework is demonstrated for the assessment of financial innovation policies for U.S. transportation infrastructure. Using hybrid agent-based/system dynamics techniques, a computational model is created to simulate the micro behaviors of state departments of transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. The results of the model include the visualization of the outcomes of different policies and the identification of the desired policy landscapes. The proposed framework provides policymakers with an integrated methodology through which an infrastructure policy problem is formulated, micro behaviors of the agents are modeled, the policy landscape is created, and the desired scenarios are identified. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Solid waste management (SWM) decision makers are under increasing pressure to implement strategies that are both cost effective and environmentally sound. Consequently, SWM has developed into a highly complex systemic planning problem and analytical tools are needed to assist in the development of more sustainable SWM strategies. Here, we present the Solid Waste Infrastructure Modelling System (SWIMS) software, which is the first non-linear dynamic, LCA-based optimisation tool for SWM that optimises for both economic and environmental performance. The environmental and economic costs of treating generated wastes at available treatment facilities are calculated through a series of life cycle process models, based on non-linear expressions defined for each waste material and each treatment process type. Possible treatment paths for waste streams are identified using a depth first search algorithm and a sequential evolutionary genetic algorithm is used to prioritise the order of these paths, in lieu of user defined optimisation criteria and constraints. SWIMS calculates waste arisings into the future and determines if it is possible to treat generated waste, while considering present and future constraints (e.g. capacity). If additional capacity is required, SWIMS will identify the optimum infrastructure solution to meet this capacity demand. A demonstrative case study of MSW management in GB from 2010 to 2050 is presented. Results suggest that sufficient capacity is available in existing and planned infrastructure to cope with future demand for SWM and meet national regulatory and legislative requirements with relatively little capital investment beyond 2020. SWIMS can be used to provide valuable information for SWM decision makers, particularly when used to analyse the effects of possible future national or regional policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present article is an attempt to perceive the universal sustainability observable in an individual country or region, where the religious, political, social-demographic, economic, environmental, creative, technological and investment subsystems are revealed not only through the vitality of spiritual and material existence media, but rather through the signs of the development of these subsystems as self-assembled units through the erosion of their interaction. The problem of optimal allocation of investment resources among the separate sustainability's subsystems was addressed by means of expert methods and techniques of portfolio methodology which will enable the achievement of the enshrined universal sustainability standards. A country-specific index composition of sustainability subsystems' indices was chosen as the universal sustainability index for the specific country. The index in its dynamics is perceived as a random process. While projecting its state and evaluating its power, i.e., the impact of the subsystem efficiency in a particular moment, this power is measured by the level of the index and the reliability or guarantee of an appropriate level. To solve the problem of investment resources allocation, the idea of Markowitz Random Field was invoked in order to reach the maximum power of sustainability index while applying the technical solution-the so-called "GoldSim" system. Engineering is a methodology that aspires to reveal the core attributes of complex systems and instruments in order to manage the possibility to influence these properties for the systems. Experimental expert evaluation and case study is performed on Lithuanian data. © 2012 by the authors.

AB  - This article proposes an agent-based model to support the development of self-sustaining regional innovation systems (RIS). Themodel is the base of a computational laboratory, CARIS (Complex Adaptive Regional Innovation System), which aims at evaluating the self-sustainability of RIS and at investigating what are the resources, competencies andmechanisms able to trigger powerful innovation and economic growth processes. Such a topic is particularly interesting for the so-called lagging regions, which, notwithstanding noticeable policy interventions, have been unable to significantly improve their innovation performances. Results of this study show that the exploration capacity, the propensity to cooperation, and the endowed competencies of actors belonging to a region could be considered as key aspects in affecting the regional innovation performance. This means that policy-makers should (i) incentivize investments in research and development activities both at the public and private levels; (ii) support public-private partnerships; (iii) enhance national and regional university systems; and (iv) increase the number of researchers employed both in the public and private sectors. In the next future, the CARIS laboratory could be adopted as policy support instrument to evaluate how much effective are current innovation policies and what are the most effective ones to reassess the current patterns. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - An integrated life cycle approach framework, including material flow analysis (MFA), Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), exergy analysis (EXA), Emergy Assessment (EMA), and emissions (EMI) has been constructed and applied to examine the energy efficiency of high speed urban bus transportation systems compared to conventional bus transport in the city of Xiamen, Fujian province, China. This paper explores the consistency of the results achieved by means of several evaluation methods, and explores the sustainability of innovation in urban public transportation systems. The case study dealt with in this paper is a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system compared to Normal Bus Transit (NBT). All the analyses have been performed based on a common yearly database of natural resources, material, labor, energy and fuel input flows used in all life cycle phases (resource extraction, processing and manufacturing, use and end of life) of the infrastructure, vehicle and vehicle fuel. Cumulative energy, material and environmental support demands of transport are accounted for. Selected pressure indicators are compared to yield a comprehensive picture of the public transportation system. Results show that Bus Rapid Transit system (BRT) shows much better energy and environmental performance than NBT, as indicated by the set of sustainability indicators calculated by means of our integrated approach. This is because of the higher efficiency of such modality (less affected by traffic, higher vehicle occupancy, suitability for large distance transportation). The study suggests that the higher economic and resource investments performed in order to provide dedicated roads, more modern transport technology and higher speed, translated into a better use of resources and lower environmental pressure, also because of the attraction of an increased number of passengers, who would have otherwise used car transportation modalities. This study also provides a clear evidence that more than one criterion is needed to address a fully reliable and sustainable urban transportation policy. An integrated approach is therefore suggested to support decision making in the presence of complex systems and different kinds of concerns to be taken into proper account. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As reflected in Chapters 1 & 2, tourism is a complex system, composed of a range of services, public and private natural and cultural resources, recreation, and entertainment. Each business within this complex industry providing a particular service, and part of a system which lacks the production and sale of a common product (Berno & Bricker, 2001; Davidson, 1998). As “an organization or economic system where goods and services are exchanged for one another or for money” businesses in tourism are uniquely challenged by the value chain they operate (Business Dictionary, 2018, p. 1). Further, the challenges associated with climate change, coupled with shared global economies (Dredge & Gyimothy, 2015) and the high speed intensity of relationship creation through social media (Budeanu, 2013), add to the increasing complexities of tourism research, and challenges the status quo with respect to business models. As Budeanu, Miller, and Moscardo (2015) have raised, the traditional business model can often be at odds with sustainable tourism, due to the need for growth, understanding of balanced use concerning resource conservation and consumption, and a critical understanding of stakeholder engagement and who actually benefits. Therefore the purpose of this chapter is to introduce ideas surrounding sustainable business models and dimensions or elements critical to addressing some of the “wicked” challenges to sustainability in the tourism sector. © Stephen F.

AB  - This paper reviews definitions and uses of the Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses (DPSIR) framework and argues that it is a relevant tool for structuring communication between scientists and end-users of environmental information, while it is inappropriate as an analytical tool. An apparently deterministic 'causal' description of environmental issues inevitably downplays the uncertainty and multiple dimensions of causality inherent in complex environmental and socio-economic systems. Consequently, the paper comõplements and reframes 'DPSIR' using a complex system methodology based on the distinction between four 'spheres' of sustainability (environmental, economic, social and political) and the analysis of their functioning and relationships. The pair-wise interface aspects are characterised through investigation of the 'demands' and 'supply' of each sphere relative to the others. Within the resulting conceptual framework, each of the five D, P, S, I and R concepts are specified, for application in integrative analysis of relationships between policy, society, economy and biodiversity in one of the world's largest European integrated research projects on biodiversity (ALARM). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Various types of 'bubbles', e.g. stock market, housing, dot.com, high-tech, historically, are commonlyobserved phenomena in complex systems. Yet, their emergence often surprises people who remain unaware of history or their systemic roots. Bubbles are often considered to be simply the product of unwise speculative investments or social mania. Alternatively, conventional economic theories often consider factors, such as interest rates, to be the trigger. However, economic theories rarely account for the systemic structure of markets or for non-linear dynamics. The authors propose that special cases may emerge in some markets to trigger instability. Specifically, when minimal interest rates and capital requirements (down payments) are become extremely low a perceptual shift occurs among consumers such that they become viewed as approximate free goods. This paper proposes that unwise economic policies may activate a free goods scenario initiating a cascading series of destabilizing events leading to market collapse. The authors propose hypothesize that such incendiary policies caused both the 1929 stock market crash and the 2008 subprime housing crisis in the United States. To more deeply examine this claim, these policies were tested using a system dynamics model based on data from both the 1929 and 2008 crises. The model simulated and tested the effects of alternative rate policies on market dynamics. Some of the rates and down payments used in both crises set off tsunami-like shock waves through markets leading to their sudden collapse in these simulations. Based on the findings of this study, found that economic policies lessened market stability. The authors propose several revisions to these policies to foster greater market sustainability. © 2015, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to the National Academy of Engineering, innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, alternative fuels, smart grids, and financial innovations are critical to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of infrastructure systems. The key to expansion of infrastructure innovations is effective policymaking. This paper adopts an Innovation System-of-Systems framework for policymakers to analyze innovation policies in interdependent infrastructure systems. The System-of-Systems framework facilitates consideration of the adaptive micro-behaviors of the components of the system within and across different levels of analysis. The application of the framework is demonstrated for the assessment of financial innovation policies for U.S. transportation infrastructure. Using hybrid Agent-based/System Dynamics techniques, a complex system model is created to simulate the micro-behaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Different policy landscapes are developed using the output of the simulation model and classification and regression tree analysis as a meta-model. The quality of the model outcomes are evaluated through conceptual model validity, data validity, internal validity, and sensitivity analysis. The model provides policymakers with a tool to: (i) consider the effects of parameters in a complex system simultaneously and (ii) simulate the landscape of possible outcomes due to different policies. © ASCE 2012.

AB  - Transportation projects, such as those for maritime ports, airports, passenger rail and freight rail are typically large investments and they can be a complex system that includes multiple modes, new technologies, operating concepts, and operators. These projects are initiated by metropolitan planning organizations, city port authorities, and statewide department of transportation agencies and others. Architectural or engineering services firms are often contracted to assist with the project planning steps. The planning processes include evaluating and ranking alternatives with subjective and quantitative criteria. Additionally, as projects evolve, there is a need to gain stakeholder approval and conduct environmental impact reviews. Simulation modeling provides a unique and flexible framework to assist with concept development, stakeholder consensus building, and public approval during environmental impact reviews. Modeling provides the ability to quantify concept performance differences between alternatives and demonstrate that a concept provides operational sustainability for each of the stakeholders and modal flows. This paper describes several transportation planning projects and how simulation modeling can provide quantitative performance metrics to support the planning processes to enable the project to move towards advanced design and engineering stages.

AB  - To assess whether China's emissions will peak around 2030, we forecast energy consumption and carbon emissions in China. We use an agent-based model driven by enterprises' innovation. Results show some differences in both energy consumption peaks and carbon emission peaks when we compare trends at different levels. We find that carbon emissions and energy consumption will peak in 2027 and 2028, respectively. However, the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries will reach energy consumption in different years: 2023, 2029, and 2022, respectively, and reach carbon emission peaks in 2022, 2028, and 2022, respectively. At the sectoral level, we find a wider range of energy consumption peaks and carbon emission peaks. Peak energy consumption occurs between 2020 and 2034, and peak carbon emissions between 2020 and 2032. Commercial and catering businesses, utilities and resident services, and finance and insurance achieve peak energy consumption and carbon emissions earliest in 2020, while building materials and other non-metallic mineral products manufacturing and metal products manufacturing are the two latest sectors to reach peak energy consumption and emissions, in 2034 and 2032, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.

AB  - In palm oil supply chain (POSC) the investment and operational risk levels between the actors may not be proportionately rewarded by the same levels of added value. However, each actor will attempt to obtain the highest reward. In this study the authors designed a model to simulate the interaction and negotiation behaviors of the actors, and to facilitate optimum distribution of the added value, while considering the successive investment and operational risk levels. Agentbased modeling approach was used for this purpose as it provided the best means to identify and study the supply chain actors (or agents) behaviors. Netlogo software was used to develop the program. This study is important because the model can facilitate further development of various formula to calculate the fair distribution of added value among the actors, therefore ensure the supply chain sustainability. The result of this study indicated that the negotiation between all actors in POSC need to consider overall supply chain sustainability while conducting pairwise negotiation, otherwise the supply chain continuity may be endangered. © ExcelingTech Pub.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing in the light of the credit crisis and catastrophic climate change. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses that the climate change, natural resource shortages, fuel crisis and global financial crisis, etc. will not go away just because there is a recession. In this regard, Shari’ah compliant finance has a broader responsibility to consider societal goals and should be preparing for the post-credit crunch world. The paper evaluates the performance of Shari’ah compliant sustainable funds using the traditional measures of performance in relation to risk-adjusted benchmarks to see if there is any ethical effect. Findings – The paper advocates that preventing future market meltdowns and avoiding catastrophic climate change requires a new era of longterism in Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The study assesses the performance of the Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing. The result shows that Shari’ah compliant funds outperformed the conventional benchmark and therefore, the challenge for Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing is not to become like conventional investing but, rather, to replace. Research limitations/implications – Shari’ah compliant sustainable finance is a recent phenomena and therefore, rigorous analytical predication of Shari’ah compliant sustainable investing variables are at present not possible using evolutionary and complex system approaches; however, such system can be fruitfully studied in future through simulation methods and certain types of econometric modeling when the long-term data will be made available. Originality/value – As the credit crunch has evolved into a full-blown economic crisis, many have turned to the Shari’ah compliant finance to provide a route map out of recession. With an increasing number of conventional banks and corporations struggling to find funds to support their businesses, Shari’ah compliant financial institutions represent a potential solution to bridge the liquidity gap in the global markets. © 2009, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - The economic crisis of 2008-2009 and beyond has provided the greatest challenge to public policy in the developed world since the Second World War, as the use of public monies to support banks and declining tax revenues have resulted in rising government borrowing and national debt. This book evaluates the failures of public policy in the half decade before the crisis, using the conceptual framework of complex systems. This analysis reveals the fundamental failings of globalization and the lack of a robust and resilient public sector paradigm to assist countries in economic recovery. The research has benefited from UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funding for a Knowledge Exchange that applied the most relevant and applied aspects of complex systems theory to contemporary policy problems. Innovative statistical methods are used to profile and group countries both before and after the 2008-09 crisis. This shows the countries that are best prepared for the ongoing and prolonged Euro zone crisis of 2010-12. The book proposes a new model of public policy that asserts itself over the paradigm of market liberalism and places the public values of full employment, sustainability and equality at the top of the post crisis policy agenda. © 2012 Philip Haynes.

AB  - Managing grid assets is an ongoing task for electricity distribution network operators (DNOs). Deep uncertainties especially in energy sustainability and flexibility make it difficult to forecast future electricity demand and corresponding grid capacity need. This makes long-term asset replacement strategy planning a complex issue. In this paper, a modeling method that uses the 'sub-grid' concept for supporting DNOs developing strategies is presented. It comprises three main parts: modeling the grid (complex system parameters), modeling demand scenarios as load patterns (uncertain input parameters) and modeling the asset replacement strategies of DNOs (multiple control parameters). Each part is introduced with examples. This method will be applied and further developed in case studies.

AB  - Most research about financial stability and sustainable growth focuses on the financial sector and macroeconomics and neglects the real sector, microeconomics and psychology issues. Real-sector and financial-sectors linkages are increasing and are a foundation of economic/social/environmental/urban sustainability, given financial crises, noise, internet, “transition economics”, disintermediation, demographics and inequality around the world. Within complex systems theory framework, this book analyses some multi-sided mechanisms and risk-perception that can have symbiotic relationships with financial stability, systemic risk and/or sustainable growth. Within the context of Regret Minimization, MN-Transferable Utility and WTAL, new theories-of-the-firm are developed that consider sustainable growth, price stability, globalization, financial stability and birth-to-death evolutions of firms. This book introduces new behaviour theories pertaining to real estate and intangibles, which can affect the evolutions of risk-taking and risk perception within organizations and investment entities. The chapters address elements of the dilemma of often divergent risk perceptions of, and risk-taking by corporate executives, regulators and investment managers. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - A proper fiscal framework should ensure long-term sustainability while avoiding pro-cyclical fiscal behaviour. In its current form, the European fiscal framework fails on both fronts. Fine-tuning the already complex system is not, in our view, a viable alternative; one has to design a fundamentally new institutional set-up, where accountabilities are clearly defined. Path-dependency should be abandoned and basic theoretical and empirical lessons respected. We propose a decentralised and depoliticised framework, which is theoretically sounder and practically more enforceable than the current web of complicated rules and procedures. Moreover, it also exploits synergies between fiscal rules and independent fiscal institutions at both the national and European levels. The financial and sovereign debt crises have shaken the very foundations of the euro area. In order to calm financial markets, European governments and institutions have adopted a wide variety of reforms and measures to avoid the break-up of the currency union. These trial-and-error and learning-by-doing methods were sometimes successful, but did not always achieve the desired outcomes. Hence there is clear consensus among economists and policymakers that additional steps are necessary to increase the euro area’s resilience to future crises. In what is known as the ‘Five Presidents’ Report’, Juncker et al. (2015) call for progress on four fronts: genuine economic union, financial union, fiscal union and political union. The main objective of this chapter is to contribute to the debate by identifying the weaknesses of the current European fiscal framework and proposing an alternative - more robust - solution. At the heart of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe lies the fundamental contradiction between bail-outs and fiscal sovereignty inside a monetary union. One cannot have both at the same time. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that absent resolution mechanisms and strong links between bank and sovereign risks were the main factors behind the bail-outs in the initial phase of the crisis. Since then, major progress has been made to set up resolution schemes and to present a roadmap towards a banking (financial) union. These are absolutely necessary building blocks of any successful currency union. Creditors and shareholders have to bear a large part of losses stemming from the insolvency of banks or even sovereigns. © L’udovít Ódor 2017.

AB  - The EU Directive 2000/60/EC, also known as the "Framework directive in the field of water policy", stresses the importance of water in human development processes and states that EU members should coordinate water policies towards a sustainable use of this resource; hence, water has a strategic role both for present and future generations and should be managed using a systemic approach. Sustainable policies for the management of water resources must also foresee the setting up of complex systems for analysis and evaluation which must be able to control and govern the entire water system, taking into account both sustainability and the economic impacts of the policies adopted. In our paper, we propose a model which, on one hand, describes the physical relationships among different economic activities and the natural water cycle, while allowing us, on the other hand, to evaluate the economic impact of water policy sustainability. For doing this, we integrate a material flow account approach with a national accounting scheme (NAMEA). This new framework allows the analyst to consider both the effect of given policies on the water cycle and the constraint produced by the sustainability problem on the economic system. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This chapter stands for justification of growing demand for supporting new theoretical and methodological approaches in development of an actual green economy’s financial framework taking into consideration modern growing risks in the ecological, economic, social, and geopolitical environments. A notable increase in environmental expenditures of both national economies and international financial institutions is determined by the global state of the economy. The climate change has been caused by escalating the energy supply struggle, the nature exhaustion, and the need for providing balance to the market stating green economy regulators. The main aim of this chapter is to study the trends and the key state green finance regulation points. The research goal could be achieved through highlighting the nature of green finance and its framework; studying the concept of green finance and innovative financial tools’ development, providing green economy’s development; and spotting trends and imperatives of regional regulation of green finance. This chapter highlights the necessity for implementing complex systemic and methodologic approaches in making the green finance framework, summarizing leading practices in green funding and green economy’s funds raising, considering limits in green finance tools’ utilization in current conditions, strengthening the power of both federal and regional authorities in solving financial problems of energy saving, and extending the practices of companies and institutions’ green financial tools’ utilization. The necessity for a green sustainable development across the globe has driven this research to use different types of instruments to point out the benefits of such a development. In addition, green finance state regulation tools have been proposed. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

AB  - Investment in sustainability strategies and technologies holds promise for significant cost savings over the operational phase of a facility's life cycle, while more effectively meeting stakeholder needs. However, accurately estimating the first costs of a green project during the early concept development stages is challenging, and effective ways to comprehensively predict potential lifecycle cost impacts of sustainability strategies do not exist. This paper describes a agent-based model (ABM) of the Total Cost of Ownership of green facilities applicable at the earliest stages of concept development. An ABM approach captures the social, environmental, and engineering systems that characterize a facility's life cycle cost. It permits evaluating the impact of the institutional and industry environment on facility life cycle performance, and also captures the cost impacts of tightly coupled facility systems that characterize green design. ©2010 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this pa\per is to understand the impact of financial key performance indicators (KPIs)—namely customer accounts receivable flow time and credit limit allowed by financial partners—on the financial sustainability of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) during business growth trajectories from an operations management perspective. This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent-based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - There has lately been an increased interest in sustainability assessment, and models have been developed to assess the sustainability of a well-defined area, for instance, a landscape, a region, or an island. The model includes not only ecological processes but also socio-economic activities. Our experiences with sustainability assessment projects are still very limited, but from many sides it has been proposed which key variables to include in such an analysis. The use of work energy as a sustainability indicator that includes expressions of natural and socio-economic activities has been proposed and also tested with reasonable success. The efficiency of the use of work energy in general and the amount of work energy needed to maintain the various subsystem and their capacity of work energy were included in this analysis. It is, however, clear that one indicator is insufficient to assess the sustainability of a very complex system. It has, therefore, been proposed to supplement the use of work energy as an indicator with the development of models of the most important element cycles for natural and socio-economic systems, namely the cycles of carbon, nitrogen, and water. Two ecological factors are in focus when it is discussed what is important to include in a sustainability analysis, namely the services offered by the ecosystems and the biodiversity, which is important for the spectrum of resistances to possible impacts on the systems. It is important to include these two ecological factors as direct indicators in the sustainability analysis, although they both to a certain extent are covered by the work energy analysis. Socio-economic indicators are, of course, also needed but it is beyond the scope of this article. The result of use of models for the assessment of the global sustainability by the use of a 'limits to growth' like model is presented. The model has been used to assess the global development in the case of: (1) more support to the developing countries by the industrialized countries, (2) more green tax, (3) more investment in pollution control, and (4) more investment in education and research. It can be shown that these investments lead to a win-win situation. © 2016 WIT Press.

AB  - Ageing populations, rapid technological progress and recent public budget cuts currently threaten the sustainability of public health systems. To meet growing needs with declining resources, decision-makers must identify new ways to avoid reducing the quality of services offered to citizens. This paper focuses on the so-called "co-payment" tools aimed to obtain additional resources for the public health budget directly from citizens. Whereas certain forms of co-payments have always been introduced within health systems to prevent moral hazard behaviours, other co-payment mechanisms are explicitly intended to help finance public healthcare systems. Literature and empirical findings do not agree about the final impact of such co-payment tools, particularly whether they can attain system sustainability and guarantee equitably delivered services. In this paper, we develop an agent-based simulation model which can be used by decision-makers as a decision support tool to compare different co-payment rules and evaluate their impact on the public budget and the health expense of different groups of citizens. © 2016 The Operational Research Society.

The overall conclusion of the presentation is that modelling is a very useful and powerful tool to assess the sustainability and it can strongly be recommended to use the positive experience gained up to now when sustainability analyses will be increasingly needed in the future. The presented methods lead to an assessment of sustainability, determination of carbon dioxide emission and a carbon balance for a given area. They can therefore be used for instance for areas of 10 × 10 km whereby the spatial distribution can be illustrated and a geo process model be developed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The assessment of the socio-economic and financial impacts of climate change represents a main source of uncertainty for policy makers and investors. However, traditional climate economics and financial risk models are not properly equipped to consider the characteristics of climate risks and the opportunities from climate-alignment, being constrained by equilibrium conditions and linearity of impacts, as well as by representative agents and intertemporal optimization. Given the closing window of opportunity to achieve the 2 °C target, there is an urgent need for a new wave of models able to embrace uncertainty and complexity deriving not only from climate impacts on socio-economic systems, but also from their reaction. In this regard, approaches rooted on evolutionary economics and complexity science could provide complementary insights to traditional climate economics models. This special issue contributes to fill in this knowledge gap by collecting nine papers applying evolutionary and complex systems approaches, and agent-based and network models to climate change economics, presented at the Special Session of the Research Area “Environment-Economics Interactions” of the European Association of Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE)'s conference 2016. By introducing conceptual and methodological innovations in climate economics and finance, the nine articles analyse the conditions for effective climate policies and financial instruments to align countries to the global climate targets, compared to the costs of inaction. This information is crucial to support decision-makers in the analysis of climate-finance policies and instruments to foster the transition to a sustainable and inclusive low-carbon economy. © 2019

AB  - This paper focuses on the use of system thinking, complex adaptive systems theory and modeling to help create and operate sustainable energy infrastructure. These are capital-intensive, long-lived large scale socio-technical systems that evolve over decades. To enable high-level decision support on climate policy, strategic investment decisions or transition management, we are evolving a simulation engine for Agent-Based simulation of infrastructure development. The key functionality and capability of this engine is its ability for playing out possible futures, to identify development patterns and conditions for sustainability by exploring multiple scenarios. Two of the models completed serve to illustrate the approach. These address the ecological impact of bio-electricity and the long-term effect of CO2 policy on the electricity production technology portfolio. Limits and opportunities of the approach are discussed and an outline for future research is given. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - Renewable energy investments require a substantial amount of capital to provide affordable and accessible energy for everyone in the world, and finding the required capital is one of the greatest challenges faced by governments and private entities. In a macroeconomic perspective, national budget deficits and inadequate policy designs hinder public and private investments in renewable projects. These problems lead governments to borrow a considerable amount of money for sustainable development, although such excessive debt-based financing pushes them to unsustainable economic development. This substantial amount of borrowing makes a negative contribution to the high global debt concentration, putting countries' economic and social development at risk. In line with this, excessive debt-based financing causes an increase in wealth inequality, and when wealth inequality reaches a dramatic level, wars and many other social problems are triggered to correct the course of wealth inequality. In this regard, the motivation behind the study is to develop a set of policy guidelines for sustainable financing models as a solution for these intertwined problems, which are: 1) a financial gap in energy investments; 2) an excessive global debt concentration; and 3) a dramatic increase in wealth inequality. To this end, this study presents a quantitative and comparative proof of concept analysis of alternative financing models in a solar farm investment simulation to investigate the change in wealth inequality and social welfare by reducing debt-based financing and increasing public participation. There are many studies in the literature investigating the evolution of wealth inequality throughout history. However, there is a gap in the literature, and investigating the effects of various policy rules on the evolution of wealth inequality in a future time frame needs to be explored in order to discuss possible policy implications beforehand. In this respect, this paper contributes to the literature by developing simulation models for conventional and alternative financing systems. This enables investigating the changes in wealth inequality and social welfare as a result of various policy implications throughout the simulation time. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - What follows is an account of the concepts of information and noise as they apply to an analysis of high-frequency trading according to ‘heterodox economics’. The text proposes a framework according to which finance can best be understood as a complex technical system tightly coupled to other social, economic systems. To be more precise, the paper attempts to show how finance is not just any complex system but it can be understood as an ecology of evolving socio-technical systems, sub-systems such as investment banks, hedge funds, high-frequency trading traders, retail investors, pensions funds, etc. All of these are the technical building blocks of our financial markets. Moreover, we attempt to show how concepts from other disciplines, such as entropy, information and noise, can be useful in opening up the world of finance from its traditional economic milieu. Although the following text is confined to the discursive realm of humanities/social sciences, it echoes the analytical approaches of econophysics and experimental economics and particularly the ongoing research around ‘computational evolutionary economics’ [Mirowski, P. 2007. “Markets Come to Bits: Evolution, Computation and Markomata in Economic Science.” Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization 63: 209–242; Mirowski, P. 2010. “Inherent Vice: Minsky, Markomata, and the Tendency of Markets to Undermine Themselves.” Journal of Institutional Economics 6: 415–443]. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of the so-called robot phase transition from human-dominated trading to the more automatic electronic trading. The current microstructure of automatic market-making can be understood as an ‘ecological niche’ developed by ultra-fast trading algorithms which ‘feed’ on the asymmetries and disparities of the wider ‘financial ecology’. They do this by dissipating noise and adding to the complexity of market microstructure a behaviour that can push the whole ecology to critical thresholds, sometimes referred to as flash crashes. This whole process can ultimately be described by Philip Mirowski's notion of ‘inherent vice’, as well as by Sir Robert May's concept of instability ‘which develops in ecosystems upon increasing bio-diversity’ [Caccioli, F., M. Marsili, and P. Vivo. 2007. “Eroding Market Stability by Proliferation of Financial Instruments.” The European Physical Journal B–Condensed Matter and Complex Systems 71: 467–479; Haldane, A., and R. May. 2011. “Systemic Risk in Banking Ecosystems.” Nature 469: 351–355]. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper discusses an appropriate framework and metrics for infrastructure analysis that can include complex systems representations for all sectors-physical, social and environmental. In order to make better decisions concerning the use of underground space, particularly in urban environments, the functions and operations of the human and physical infrastructure systems must be understood in an integrated framework with common and meaningful metrics and representations. Considering the importance of economics, sustainability and vulnerability to extreme events, decision makers need an understanding of the valuation for underground space as a resource in order to consider life-cycle engineering and trade-offs and pros and cons of above- and below-ground infrastructure investments.

AB  - A sustainable development (SD) concept formulated 30 years ago has been, and will be, one of the most topical issues in the development of mankind. The fundamental question of this phenomenon is the quantification of the condition. There is no unified approach yet, despite numerous studies of all kinds. All proposed methods assess not sustainable development but rather the development of its individual components (economic, social, environmental) or socioeconomic systems (SES).In order to achieve an adequate quantification of SES SD, two aspects of this process should be distinguished: quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative side is the order (dynamics) of the development of the socioeconomic system, which can be expressed in the degree and intensity of development. The qualitative side is the coherence of the development of SES as a complex system. Socioeconomic systems belong to large, complex systems with the structure as an essential characteristic, which is the basis for their stability. It is the harmony of development that reflects the coherence between structural changes in development and internal development processes. The complex quantification of SES in sustainable development integrates both sides of this process-quantitative and qualitative, i.e. sustainability and harmony. © 2019, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

AB  - Financial markets are exposed to systemic risk (SR), the risk that a major fraction of the system ceases to function, and collapses. It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed ‘Systemic Risk Tax’ (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To develop more sustainable industrial systems industrialists and policy makers need to better understand how to respond to economic, environmental, and social challenges and transform industrial behaviour by leveraging appropriate industrial technology investments to reshape the current manufacturing value chain. Investments have to be collected on the private as well as public sides taking into account the stakeholders’ macro-economic framework. Since aggregate mathematical models, assuming informed, rational behaviour leading to equilibrium conditions cannot catch the resulting complexity, an agent-based modelling and simulation approach is proposed to investigate policies to support investments in resource efficiency. The EURACE agent-based framework has been adopted and modified by coupling the environmental sector with other established macroeconomic dimensions. The findings of this research establish the potential and capability of the proposed approach for investigating policies for sustainability transition analysis and evaluation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Intelligent products are an undeniable asset for efficient product lifecycle management (PLM), providing ways to capture events related to physical objects at various locations and times. Today and more than ever before, PLM tools and systems must be built upon standards for enhancing interoperability among all product stakeholders and developing tools independent of specific vendors, applications, and operating systems. Based on this observation, this paper develops strategies to improve "information sustainability" in PLM environments using standardized communication interfaces defined by a recent standard proposal named quantum lifecycle management (QLM) messaging standards. More concretely, data synchronization models based upon QLM standards are developed to enable the synchronization of product-related information among various systems, networks, and organizations involved throughout the product lifecycle. Our proposals are implemented and assessed based on two distinct platforms defined in the healthcare and home automation sectors. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (REM) is a tool that modem construction uses to deal with sustainability issues. This system brings together different branches within one project, which provides efficient information flow among specific professions, facilitates implementation of the building into operation and sustaining the information over the whole building life cycle. This allows facility management of the building to be efficient over its whole lifetime, including the final deconstruction. BIM is not just a trend: it is an internationally recognised construction tool providing a wide range of possibilities of use. Enough RIM projects have been developed to support ordinary and full implementation of the tool in construction processes. The projects should be continuously assessed and data collected in order to evaluate advantages and efficiency of BIM on the facilities buiLt. A complex system of assessment should be introduced, which would provide information on the process and final outcomes of applying BIM into the project in terms of sustainahility, economy, process cohesion, data administration and operation efficiency. This system of assessment can be a tool for orientation when the investor needs a clear understanding of whether all important measures, which had been agreed, were introduced and taken properly so that the advantages of BIM can be expected to their full extent. To describe the method of applying BIM in a project, KPI indicators are used.

AB  - The concept of sustainability, and especially sustainable development, is among the most ambitious and controversial concepts in the scientific literature. Knowledge and research concerning the condition, development or transformation of sustainability has become not only the original means of the generation of socio-economic science knowledge. It is also an alternative for the analysis of especially sophisticated development problems – e.g. the problems of survival, effective change and avoidance of huge losses pertaining to such complexes as cities, countries or regions. Finding the ways of such knowledge conversion into the field of science is complex, but there is no alternative. Research of sustainable development has already become especially prevalent, and, thus, the objects of cognition should be structured, possibilities should be consolidated, and the efficiency of the use of resources must be elevated. The first challenge of sustainability research conversion into the sustainability science is a thorough mastering of the systemic research technologies, as well as the development of the principal methodology of systemic research while evolving the possibilities of civilisation survival on Earth.; The objective of the research is to find an adequate quantitative measure of complex system development sustainability and investigate in detail the type of development of a small country or region that could be named as a realisation of sustainable development possibilities. The methodology of the research includes the application of an adequate portfolio model, stochastic optimisation, and systemic analysis. The conclusions obtained by the research state that development possibilities of a small country should not be evaluated only in terms of economic-ecological aspects; more components, such as politics, integration, marketing, social-demographics, creativity, religion, innovation, finance, and investment should be included, which could be logically divided into four subsystems of country universal sustainability. The research also presents the adequate composition of efficiency and reliability of the general effect pertaining to the activity of all the subsystems, as well as the optimal allocation of marginal investment unit among the four subsystems. © 2014, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

AB  - Nowadays, organizations are required to be part of a global collaborative world. Sometimes this is the only way they can access new and wider markets, reaching new opportunities, skills and sharing assets, e.g. tools, lessons learnt. However, due to the different sources of enterprise models and semantics, organizations are experiencing difficulties in exchanging information electronically and seamlessly. To solve this issue, most of them try to attain interoperability by establishing peer-to-peer mapping morphisms with different business partners, or in optimized networks use neutral data standards to regulate communications. Moreover, more and more enterprise systems are dynamic, looking forward to meet further requirements, causing new interoperability problems and efficiency reduction. This paper proposes a multi-agent framework to monitor existing enterprise system networks, being capable of detecting morphism changes. An example from systems engineering is presented, where network harmonization breakings are timely detected, and possible solutions are suggested to regain the interoperable status, thus enhancing robustness for reaching sustainability of business networks. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Biogas production from manure has been proposed as a partial solution to energy and environmental concerns. However, manure markets face distortions caused by considerable unbalance between supply and demand and environmental regulations imposed for soil and water protection. Such market distortions influence the cooperation between animal farmers, biogas producers and arable land owners causing fluctuations in manure prices paid (or incurred) by animal farmers. This paper adopts an agent-based modeling approach to investigate the interactions between manure suppliers, i.e., animal farmers, and biogas producers in an industrial symbiosis case example consisting of 19 municipalities in the Overijssel region (eastern Netherlands). To find the manure price for successful cooperation schemes, we measure the impact of manure discharge cost, dimension and dispersion of animal farms, incentives provided by the government for bioenergy production, and the investment costs of biogas plants for different scales on the economic returns for both actor types and favorable market conditions. Findings show that manure exchange prices may vary between −3.33 €/t manure (i.e., animal farmer pays to biogas producer) and 7.03 €/t manure (i.e., biogas producer pays to animal farmer) and thanks to cooperation, actors can create a total economic value added between 3.73 €/t manure and 39.37 €/t manure. Hence, there are cases in which animal farmers can profitably be paid, but the presence of a supply surplus not met by demand provides an advantage to arable land owners and biogas producers in the price contracting phase in the current situation in the Netherlands. © 2017 The Authors

AB  - This article explores the emergence of leadership during implementation of a water saving initiative in the rural community surrounding Barren Box Swamp in the Murray Darling Basin, Australia. Qualitative data analysis indicated that the system elements affecting the type of leadership to emerge included the extent to which the groups were engaged in the process, the level of access to resources, and the level of investment in the outcomes of the project. Although these results reinforced key aspects of complex problem-solving through collaboration, they demonstrated varying degrees and types of both engagement and leadership within the case community. Given the current finding that these varying elements can coincide within one system, this case suggests that each community’s characteristics, resources and context will determine the optimal combination of leadership style and level of collaboration needed to facilitate sustainable community development. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Quantifying local community's acceptance of mining projects and how that changes over time has remained one of the challenging tasks in evaluating socio-political risks associated with mining investments. The local community is one of the key stakeholders that determine the success and sustainability of mining projects. Evaluating the local community's level of acceptance, which depends on community demographics and the nature of the mine, over the project life cycle, is intricate. Some studies have been conducted to understand the correlation between mine characteristics and community demographics, on one hand, and the community's preferences for development using discrete choice theory. Nevertheless, not much has been done to model dynamic local community acceptance over the project life cycle, although modeling may provide insights beyond static surveys. As part of an ongoing effort towards this goal, this paper presents a model of dynamic local community acceptance of mining project as a function of changes in population age, and associated attributes, using agent-based modeling (ABM). The model, built in Matlab, describes the people in the community as independent agents. The agents' environment is defined by a set of common variables that describe the mine development and general demographics (e.g., fertility rates). The agents' utility function is derived from the discrete choice model from Ivanova and Rolfe (2011), which is used to derive an odds ratio. Five year simulations are carried out using data from Ivanova and Rolfe (2011). The results show a marginal decrease in the percentage of the population supporting the project over time. This paper discusses the possible causes of this change in support trend over time. Future research would incorporate other dynamic demographic and environmental variables to facilitate dynamic simulation. This would assist investors and stakeholders to understand drivers of community acceptance early in project planning and design.

AB  - This work describes an approach, developed through the use of Agent-Based Modeling, to investigate the financial and technical viability of Next-Generation Networks (NGNs). Bringing to fruition NGNs is such a complex task that new cooperation models among involved players - consistent with the long term sustainability of the large investments required - and innovative tools to describe the complexity of their interactions are necessary. Cooperation and complexity are recurring concepts, in projects established to develop NGNs, where relationships among cooperating entities can not be modeled through linear mathematics and/or classical prediction systems. The modeling and investigation of emergent behaviors performed through the analysis of ad-hoc created, simulation scenarios seems to be one the few ways to perform any meaningful analysis. Among the methods that are becoming more and more popular, today, there is the so called Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), where a complex system is modeled as a dynamic network of autonomous, interacting entities named agents. In this work, the authors present a brief overview of this methodology and discuss the application to the development of NGNs, both from a theoretical and a practical point of view, by developing a specific business case to gain insights about the feasibility of modern communication infrastructures - better known as NGNs' programs. The results of the performed investigations show that the level of complexity is so high, for these projects, that new cooperation models among the involved players become a necessity, in order to succeed in achieving the goals to secure both the return of the investment and the attainment of better, advanced communications - thus enabling greater efficiency in business, stronger fulfillment of a fundamental need of individuals, but above all, giving a larger contribution to the development of a better society. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Sustainability of infrastructure systems involves multiple interrelated objectives which are dependent on the dynamic behaviors of stakeholders, interdependencies between infrastructure assets, and evolving conditions in the social and environmental systems. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a framework that integrates: (1) different dimensions of sustainability in infrastructure networks, and (2) dynamic changes in the behaviors of stakeholders, asset performance conditions, and the social and environmental conditions. The proposed framework includes an agent based simulation model to capture the dynamic behaviors of decision makers and the evolving performance of infrastructure assets under different socio-environmental conditions. The outcomes of the simulation model include the short- and long-term costs and environmental impacts of infrastructure networks under different scenarios related to the changes in the socio-environmental conditions. The application of the framework is shown in a numerical case study of a road network. The results include: (i) identification of infrastructure management strategies (e.g., maintenance planning and funding allocation) that optimize the tradeoff between annual cost and environmental impacts of the network; and (ii) discovering robust management strategies that lead to highly-likely desired sustainability outcomes across different uncertain scenarios related to the future socio-environmental conditions. The results show the capability of the proposed framework for sustainability assessment of infrastructure systems based on integrated analysis of the dynamic behaviors of decision-makers, infrastructure characteristics, and evolving socio-environmental conditions. Hence, it provides a predictive quantitative tool to inform decision-making and policy formulation toward improving the sustainability of infrastructure networks. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - We investigate appropriate banking and regulatory policies aimed at pushing the banking sector to shift from speculative lending, the cause of asset bubbles and economic crises, to green investments lending, so as to foster the transition to a more energy efficient production technology. For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms’ investments and households’ house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Any critical infrastructure is controlled and managed by networked information and communication technologies (ICT) systems. Tremendous progress in the emerging area of ubiquitous, pervasive and tangible computing enables hardware and software to be integrated to a degree that makes possible a technological revolution in which ICT systems merged with physical infrastructure will be transformed together into a vast intelligence network, called an 'eNetwork'. eNetworks are the 'nervous system' of interdependent critical infrastructures and as such are the 'the weakest link'. We introduce a novel approach to building resilient critical supply networks of any kind (electricity, water, gas, finances, materials and products, etc). The proposed approach endows the eNetworked infrastructure with self-awareness such that it is able to identify possible threats or emerging vulnerabilities and reconfigure itself to attain resilience to both accidental failures and malicious attacks. By using natural models of emergence, much in the same manner that DNA is controlled in genetic engineering, we will be able to control the emergence of a network configuration resilient to anticipated threats before they manifest. The novelty consists in the integration of context-aware modelling as a tool for controlling the clustering mechanism through which the eNetwork self-organizes its services to tune its resilience according to the dynamics of the occurring situation. A significant step forward in the area of complexity science this novel approach enables a major breakthrough in the way we interact with the surrounding environment and physical world. Resilient eNetworks open perspectives unthinkable before on how to approach major technological, economic, societal and ecological problems of international concern, such as blackout-free electricity generation and distribution, optimization of energy consumption, networked transportation and manufacturing, disaster response, efficient agriculture, environmental monitoring, financial risk and sustainability assessment. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Recently enacted regulations in Canada and elsewhere require water utilities to be financially self-sustaining over the long-term. This implies full cost recovery for providing water and wastewater services to users. This study proposes a new approach to help water utilities plan to meet the requirements of the new regulations. A causal loop diagram is developed for a financially self-sustaining water utility which frames water and wastewater network management as a complex system with multiple interconnections and feedback loops. The novel System Dynamics approach is used to develop a demonstration model for water and wastewater network management. This is the first known application of System Dynamics to water and wastewater network management. The network simulated is that of a typical Canadian water utility that has under invested in maintenance. Model results show that with no proactive rehabilitation strategy the utility will need to substantially increase its user fees to achieve financial sustainability. This increase is further exacerbated when price elasticity of water demand is considered. When the utility pursues proactive rehabilitation, financial sustainability is achieved with lower user fees. Having demonstrated the significance of feedback loops for financial management of water and wastewater networks, the paper makes the case for a more complete utility model that considers the complexity of the system by incorporating all feedback loops. © 2011.

AB  - The forest-based bioproduct field has diversified into the chemical, medical, energy, nanoproduct, and construction material sectors. This paper argues that forest-based bioeconomy has kept the focus on conventional products and new bioproducts have primarily been developed as extensions to existing product portfolios due to a lock-in mechanism, i.e., a state where an economy gradually locks itself to a dominant market position due to technical interrelatedness, economies of scale, and quasi-irreversibility of investment. The study examines forest-based product transition in the context of lock-in mechanisms through narrative analysis over the past 170 years. A theoretical framework is formulated based on complex system studies and the economics of lock-in mechanisms. The relation between the lock-in mechanisms of the regime and product diversification is described for the forest-based bioeconomy in Finland. The study supports previous findings indicating that interactions occur between the lock-in mechanisms. Furthermore, lock-in mechanisms can have a neutral, adverse, or beneficial effect on product diversification. The paper extends knowledge about the role and functioning of lock-in mechanisms in changing market environments. Recent trends in network development and foreign investment, and their effects on industrial symbiosis and product diversification, is recommendable to consider in future research. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Every day more evidence surfaces about the dire state of the environment. More and more, sustainable development is fundamentally about meeting human needs while restoring balance to the global ecosystem that is failing. Greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets and other new environmental performance targets are rapidly being adopted across the globe to try to shore up this degradation. We are finally entering the era of broad scale environmental accountability. Achieving sustainability performance targets across complex and integrated social, ecological, and economic systems requires new ways of engineering the way we interact with the environment. In turn, ecologically engineering the built environment requires new quantitative performance approaches to planning. It requires understanding and analyzing the complex systematic relationships between the built and natural environment and capitalizing on the efficiencies that can be found through integrated design. The sustainability movement is currently focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the threats to sustainability run much deeper than that. Climate change is driving changes to nearly all ecosystem services upon which we rely. Reducing carbon emissions has taken a front seat in sustainability programming, but typically through a somewhat focused lens of energy and transportation systems. This paper will discuss an approach to sustainability that is more holistic and ecosystem based. One that optimizes the ecological opportunities of a site and technology to make the built environment more sustainably integrated with the natural environment at the site, region, and global scale.

AB  - The coal city is a complex system composed of the subsystems such as population, resource, economic and environment. Sustainability in the coal city depends on the reasonable structure, development pattern of each subsystem and their effective adjustment. The concept of sustainability and the simulation method of system dynamics were combined, the system dynamics model for the coal city was built on the analysis of its' structure. The adjustment parameters such as procreate index, investment ratio of industry and resource recycling rate etc, were confirmed. The typical coal city of Jixi is taken as an example; live future development patterns were designed and run on the model. The simulated results indicate that the sustainable development pattern is the best development pattern for Jixi comparatively. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Energy conservation in residential buildings has been a topic of interest in recent years because of their high levels of energy consumption. Weatherization is set of approaches that can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient, thereby helping residents lower their energy bills and improving environmental sustainability. However, there are two significant challenges associated with weatherization adoption: high upfront investment costs with a long payback period, and minimal awareness of weatherization and its benefits. This paper proposes an agent-based model that will allow researchers to explore residents' socially-motivated energy conservation decisions by providing a realistic social context via a multilayer social network and incorporating opinion dynamics based on the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered epidemic model. Several experimental scenarios are run to demonstrate the model's potential to help policymakers determine how to encourage residential weatherization adoption.

AB  - Public agencies make significant investments in capital facilities to meet the requirements of their missions. Interest in sustainable building practices has increased over recent years, but obstacles remain to implementing such practices in public construction projects on a regular basis. A primary stumbling block is the difficulty in generating accurate estimates for total cost of ownership of a facility in the early stages of design. This paper builds on previously published work to describe the prototype implementation of an agent based model to help determine the inputs for cost modeling. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The overexploitation of natural resources and the increasing number of social conflicts following from their unsustainable use point to a wide gap between the objectives of sustainability and current resource management practices. One of the reasons for the difficulties to close this gap is that for evolving complex systems like natural and socio-economic systems, sustainability cannot be a static objective. Instead sustainable development is an open evolutionary process of improving the management of social-ecological systems, through better understanding and knowledge. Therefore, natural resource management systems need to be able to deal with different temporal, spatial and social scales, nested hierarchies, irreducible uncertainty, multidimensional interactions and emergent properties. The co-evolutionary perspective outlined in this paper serves as heuristic device to map the interactions settled in the networks between the resource base, social institutions and the behaviour of individual actors. For this purpose we draw on ideas from complex adaptive systems theory, evolutionary theory and evolutionary economics. Finally, we outline a research agenda for a co-evolutionary approach for natural resource management systems. © 2007.

AB  - Large passenger transfer hub tends to have complex architectural spaces, wayfinding system plays a positive role in improving the service level of transfer and encouraging travelers to choose public transport. Based on the complexity of building space features and requirements of hub management function, the design of pedestrian-oriented signage system essentially can be summarized as complex decision problems. However, there are few researches on the determination of the locations and the content in order to make an acceptable wayfinding to all participants, especially considering the public transport priority and the sustainable finance. Aiming at this problem, the technique of multi-objective optimization is used as the core tool. The method converted this complex system decision problem into mathematical models based on three objectives (maximizing the level of space-guided, minimizing the financial investment, and minimizing the guidance distance). © ASCE.

AB  - Purpose: This paper seeks to examine the potential for simplified market value and non market value based banded approaches to be utilised for residential property tax purposes. The broad aim is to ascertain whether relatively low complexity approaches to establishing a property tax base can perform adequately in comparison to established best practice - in essence whether there is evidence of equifinality (equivalent performance from approaches of substantially different complexity) between simpler and more complex approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The research comprises empirical analysis of a database of property sales and property attribute data drawn from a UK District Council area. Several simplified methods are used to create different tax base scenarios and the outflowing tax incidence is compared with that of using a complex, industry standard market value approach. The methods of comparison are regression and spline regression based models testing for tax inequity, drawn from the literature. The approach here differs from previous work in that it occurs at the actual tax bill level allowing the comparison of value, non-value and banded approaches. Findings: The findings of the research indicate that simplified approaches to establishing a property tax base can perform in a broadly similar fashion to more complex systems currently practiced in developed economies and therefore evidence of equifinality exists. Practical implications: The research provides useful tools to property tax policy makers and practitioners in developing and transitional economies in furthering their aspirations of embedding robust property taxes for the furtherance of socio-economic and political development and the general wellbeing of society and they are of value to property tax policy makers and to academics in the field. Originality/value: The paper provides evidence of the efficacy of simplified and banded approaches as an option for jurisdictions in developing and transitional economic circumstances or elsewhere in circumstances which mitigate against full scale appraisal of the property tax base to discrete market values. The approaches and techniques pioneered open up opportunities to carry out a range of new comparative analysis of tax base options. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Boarding is one of the major processes of airplane turnaround time, with a direct influence on the airline companies' costs. From a sustainable point of view, a faster completion of the boarding process has impact not only on the airline company's long-term performance, but also on customers' satisfaction and on the airport's possibility of offering more services without additional investments in new infrastructure. Considering the airplane boarding strategies literature, it can be observed that the latest papers are dealing with developing faster boarding strategies, most of them considering boarding using just one-door of the aircraft. Even though boarding on one-door might be feasible for the airports having the needed infrastructure and sufficient jet-bridges, the situation is different in European airports, as the use of apron buses is fairly common. Moreover, some of the airline companies have adapted their boarding pass in order to reflect which door one should board once they get down from the bus. While using these buses, the boarding strategies developed in the literature are hard to find their applicability. Thus, a new method for boarding on two-door airplanes when apron buses are used is proposed and tested against the actual boarding method. A model is created in NetLogo 6.0.4, taking advantages of the agent-based modeling and used for simulations. The results show a boarding time reduction of 8.91%. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is seen as an important step towards environmental sustainability. Perhaps not surprising, many governments all around the world are providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). A positive response from consumers means that the demand for the charging infrastructure increases as well. We investigate how an existing traditional parking lot, upgraded with chargers, can suit the present demand for charging stations. In particular, a resulting EV-enabled parking lot is an electricity trading agent (i.e., broker) which acts as an energy retailer and as a player on a target electricity market. In this paper, we use agent-based simulation to present the EV-enabled parking lot ecosystem in order to model the underlying dynamics and uncertainties regarding parking lots with electricity trading agent functionalities. We instantiate our agentbased simulations using real-life data in order to perform the what-if analysis. Several key performance indicators (KPIs), including parking utilization, charging utilization and electricity utilization, are proposed. We also illustrate how those KPIs can be used to choose the effective investment strategy with respect to the number and speed of chargers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Forest resilience to climate change is a topic of national concern as our standing assets and future forests are important to our livelihood. Many tree species are predicted to decline or disappear while others may be able to adapt or migrate. Efforts to quantify and disseminate the current condition of forests are urgently needed to guide management and policy. Here, we develop a new indicator to summarize raw density-independent mortality of forested stands by species from the last decade of the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century using forest inventory data. We define density-independent mortality to be stand mortality by species due to processes unrelated to natural mortality from succession or stand maturation, which is marked by overall increase in tree girth at the expense of density of individuals. We assess trends for 22 species on national forests in two U.S. states, Washington and Oregon. Populations of some species including timber species have no or low overall levels of density-independent mortality (Juniperus occidentalis, Abies procera, Thuja plicata, Tsuga heterophylla, Pinus ponderosa, and Pseudotsuga menziesii). In contrast, other species demonstrate unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality (Pinus monticola, Arbutus menziesii, Pinus albicaulis, Abies lasiocarpa, Taxus brevifolia, Pinus contorta, Abies grandis, Picea englemanii, and Larix occidentalis). Additionally, the net potential for unsustainable levels of density-independent mortality in standing populations does not necessarily warrant concern when examined across species for our study area and time period; however, when examined by species, the number of species in decline exceeds the number of species where mortality can be generally attributed to endogenous self-thinning. We argue that this work can aid management and policy decisions and our understanding of complex vegetation dynamics in a changing climate. Application of the indicator at larger spatial scales and in conjunction with data on migration and establishment may be used to address questions such as, how can we make cost-effective management decisions to ensure long-term sustainability of tree species and forests? Tree species distributions across the landscape are complex systems, and raw characterization of current trends occurring in forest inventories is important especially given the uncertainty associated with the modeling and prediction of complex systems such as tree species. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The integral utilization of biomass for energy, chemicals, and materials production, within the concept of biorefineries, has been considered to have potential benefits for economy, environment, and society. However, concerns exit about their expansion and consequences for human well-being at different scales. This chapter introduces the concepts of biorefinery and sustainability and discusses their interrelation together with the role of biomass fractionation in this complex system. The chapter continues discussing the most debated environmental and socioeconomic aspects associated with biomass exploitation, building from the experiences of bioenergy toward the more diverse concept of biorefinery. The topics are discussed from two perspectives, the biomass supply side and biomass fractionation, covering aspects like greenhouse gas emissions, primary energy use, land use change, biodiversity, water use, soil quality, food security, employment, value generation, and infrastructure investments. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent literatures about complex systems indicate that the economy self-organizes under control mechanisms. By applying the theory of control mechanism to capitalism, this paper analyzes why the ongoing world financial crisis is a credit crisis and the epistemological root of credit crisis-information asymmetry. Furthermore, this paper argues that neo-liberalism economic system and the defective credit management system, which lead to the deficient government supervision and consistent lack of effective government supervision, caused the world financial crisis. This paper also argues that rescue measures taken by many countries cannot resolve the financial crisis fundamentally. Some measures are proposed at the end of this paper to strengthen the negative feedbacks, aiming at defusing or avoiding crises fundamentally. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The increasing number of ethical investment funds shows how the need of ethics in asset management is growing up. In the same time, in some markets, autonomous agents are managing a larger number of financial transactions than human do. If many philosophers and economists discuss the fairness of different approaches for responsible investment, there is no strong proposition today about the implementation of autonomous agents able to take into account ethical notions in their financial decisions. This article proposes an approach to represent morals and ethics in a BDI architecture and illustrates its use in the context of ethical asset management. An analysis of a first experimentation on a simulated market is given.

AB  - China's rapid urbanization has produced a number of resources and environmental problems, making it necessary to provide a scientific basis for the promotion of sustainable urbanization. This study integrates systems theory with complexity science to create an Urbanization-Resources-Environment complex system (URE) to assess the sustainability of urbanization, beginning by conjoining a theory of urbanization and ecological environment coupling. We developed a comprehensive coordinated development index for URE (URECDI) to represent the internal connectivity and influence between the urbanization, resources and environmental subsystems, and also indicate the sustainability of urbanization. This study analyzed trends observed in URE for 13 cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region (JJJ) of China, using statistical data collected from 2005 to 2015. The main results are: (1) urbanization efficiency, resource utilization efficiency and environmental quality are the largest influences on the indices, which indicates that they are key factors in the behavior of URE; (2) coordination between subsystems of URE within JJJ was not good, but showed an increasing trend during 2005–2015; and (3) URECDI indicated significant differences between 13 cities, which suggests that we can increase coordination within URE by implementing a zoning strategy, and adjusting policies and investment to favor low-coordinated cities. The coordinated development index can reveal the overall characteristics of URE and ensure regionally sustainable urbanization. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Globalization processes and European integration of Ukraine require the consideration of a complex system of international norms in the state policy development. The priority direction of international organizations' activity in the sphere of economy is sustainable development, in order to ensure the implementation of the goals of which there is a need for the introduction of a circular economy. State policy in such an economic model is an instrument for solving economic and environmental problems; it is intended to ensure the reorientation of economic systems to the conditions of sustainable development, as well as the use of waste as resources that promote economic growth. Reforming the economic system towards the provisions of such an economy is the duty of public administration. Formation of an effective state policy of the circular economy and mechanisms for its implementation will increase the competitiveness of the economy, provide environmental sustainability and help to achieve social consensus. The article substantiates the need for the introduction of the provisions of the circular economy in Ukraine. It also presents a conceptual model which specifies the tasks of the state policy aimed at the propmotion of such an economic model as well as the way and methods of their implementation. © 2018 Polish Economic Society.

AB  - Cooperative behaviour is a fundamental strategy for survival; it positively affects economies, social relationships, and makes larger societal structures possible. People vary, however, in their willingness to engage in cooperative behaviour in a particular context. Here we examine whether AI can be effectively used to to alter individuals' implicit understanding of cooperative dynamics, and hence increase cooperation and participation in public goods projects. We developed an intervention - the Sustainability Game (SG) - to allow players to experience the consequences of individual investment strategies on a sustainable society. Results show that the intervention significantly increases individuals' cooperative behaviour in partially anonymised public goods contexts, but enhances competition one-on-one. This indicates our intervention does improve transparency of the systemic consequences of individual cooperative behaviour. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Simulation and modeling have long served the domain of complex systems such as energy systems. The system of supply and demand of electricity in Canada is highly complex and dynamic in nature. Understanding the causal relationships among the system's nearly immeasurable amount of variables and the patterns that exist in Canada's electricity system is essential for systematic and sustainable policy decisions. Drawing on system dynamics methodology, this study presents a dynamic simulation model. By utilizing the developed and validated system dynamics model, this research finds that, in addition to the traditional adjustment methods, substantial new investments in electricity generation capacity and efficiency enhancement areas are needed to achieve a sustainable and balanced electricity supply and demand system in Canada. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The first part presents a conceptual model of the economic system in its ecological and social context. It is developed via an integration of basic concepts in physical resource theory, animal and human physiology, economic theory and systems ecology. The capacity of the model to support analysis of such complex systems where life is a key system characteristic is high. The conceptual model shows the dependency of the human economy on support by non-renewable and renewable resources from Nature (i. e. ecological source restrictions), as well as the capacity of ecosystems to assimilate wastes (ecological sink restrictions). The analysis focuses general principles; thus, the high level of abstraction results in an apparent simplicity. In the second part, we integrate traditional economic production functions and the conceptual model, which results in the formulation of a biophysically anchored production function (BAPF). The BAPF by itself, and through the system of ecological economic accounts that can be derived from it, represent a toolbox that supports the operationalisation of a sustainable development from micro to macro level. It is coherent with Impredicative Loop Analysis, existing management systems within agricultural sciences, OECD's principles for sustainable development and the approach of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Compared to analytical approaches used in the formulation of sustainability policies in the private and public sphere, based on conceptual models ignoring the complexity when life (bios) is a defining system characteristic, its relevance for the operationalisation of sustainable development approaches infinity. The third part presents results from statistical analysis of relations between gross domestic product and energy supply and some emissions, respectively, for different nations and time periods, delivering values on levels and trends for parameters in the BAPF as well as a first test of the relevance of the BAPF proposed. The paper is ended by a theoretical analysis of the costs of provoking an economic system working under ecological source and sink restrictions to follow exponential growth: The need to decouple economic growth from natural resource use and emissions is highlighted. Otherwise, the erosion of the ecological foundation of the economy with regard to source as well as sink aspects will be a function of exponential growth. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - This chapter argues that a transformative approach is necessary, involving radical economic change towards environmental sustainability and social justice -conceived of as two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing forces. It provides conceptual framings for the change processes required that are to be found in a relational philosophy and complex systems thinking applied to a broader vision of the economy, including a framing of environmental sustainability as a social justice issue, and viewing the changes needed through a transitioning systems lens. New industries must be developed in a socially inclusive manner and workers will need re-skilling for different jobs. A new development path requires concerted interventions including aligned skills development. In the face of dire socio-economic issues, environmental concerns have been deemed less important, and juxtaposed as being in competition with poverty eradication and employment creation. Humanity surely does have the creativity to design different social, cultural and economic systems over time, suitable for different contexts. © 2020 Eureta Rosenberg, Presha Ramsarup and Heila Lotz- Sisitka.

AB  - In this paper, health information exchange (HIE) adoption barriers, challenges, influencing factors, and the impacts of policy interventions among ambulatory providers and acute-hospitals in the State of Maryland health care system are examined. The main areas discussed are HIE sustainability, financial benefits, return on investment, and the correlation between HIE and hospital readmission reductions. The proposed policies include financial incentives to adopt HIE (policy 1), awareness and education to integrate HIE into the workflow (policy 2), and a combination of policies 1 and 2 to address the most frequent barriers identified in the literature. System dynamics simulation modeling combined with statistical analyses were utilized based on monthly time-series datasets. The design for each policy was developed considering HIE adoption barriers, challenges, and influencing variables. The simulation focused on presenting the findings of many HIE adoption studies. The results suggested significant financial advantages of using HIE (an approximately $3.3 billion cumulative gain over 10 years). Ambulatory provider adoption of HIE is slow but contributes the most to the overall HIE portal queries. Three datasets were analyzed with regard to hospital readmission reductions, HIE portal query usage, and encounter-notification service alerts. Strong positive correlation coefficients of 0.75 and 0.8, respectively, were determined. Finally, the designed policy interventions (policy 1, policy 2, and combination) showed a positive effect on HIE adoption rate by 15.87%, 8.36% and 21.17% respectively. This research can be used as a framework to provide policy makers and strategic thinkers with a methodology for analyzing such complex systems and generate well informed HIE adoption policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper studies the diffusion of greenhouse agriculture in a watershed in the northern uplands of Thailand by applying econometrics and agent-based modeling in combination. Adoption has been rapid by farmers in the central valley of the watershed, while farmers at higher altitudes, lacking transferable land titles that could serve as mortgage collateral, have been unable to obtain loans for greenhouse investment. The objectives of the paper are both methodological and empirical. On the methodological side, it shows that econometrically estimated models of farm household behavior are useful to design and to parameterize an agent-based model. On the empirical side, simulation results show that if mortgage collateral would not be required, then adoption in the upper part of the watershed could reach nearly 77% of farm households by 2020, as compared to about 36% under current conditions. Furthermore results suggest a significant increase in incomes related to the innovation and a substantially greater irrigation water use, especially in the central part. As bell pepper under greenhouses has replaced pesticide-intensive chrysanthemum, it has declined average levels of pesticide use. Nevertheless, pesticide use is high and farmers are struggling to control pests, which raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the innovation. © 2009 Canadian Agricultural Economics Society.

AB  - The implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation policies depend on the development of green technologies whose diffusion is constrained by a number of barriers which prevent them to spread broadly and at a fast pace. By means of an agent-based computational model, the paper investigates the macro and micro economic dynamics considering the role of a “traditional” commercial bank and a state investment bank that explicitly supports green investments. Simulation results emphasize that green finance matter and that the market diffusion of environmental innovation is more pronounced when the presence of the public investment bank is combined with strong consumers’ preferences oriented towards environmental quality. The relevance of the paper is twofold. Besides contributing to the literature on the finance-innovation nexus by considering the role of climate finance within a complex systems framework, it provides a model that can be used as a tool to explore policies to foster environmental innovation diffusion. © 2018

AB  - Energy systems exist to provide industry, commerce, and households with fuels and energy-services. In addition to financial cost and reliability imperatives, these systems are now being asked to perform across a range of sustainability criteria. Most national systems fall well short on this second count and governments need to promote a suitable transition. Market liberalization over the last 20 years has made this task more challenging in public policy terms and yet could provide good incentives for innovation, reinvestment, and user responsiveness, given the right institutional measures. The development of suitable public policy may necessitate sophisticated simulation techniques, particularly considering the technical and commercial complexities involved, the multi-criteria nature of the policy problem, and the fact that most interventions will interact. This paper presents xeona (extensible entity-oriented optimization-based network-mediated analysis), an object-oriented simulation environment designed for such use and currently under development. The modeling ethos is to represent important entities from the problem domain as elements within the simulation domain. Hence a xeona model is built from the ground up using the technical plant, controllers, markets, actors, and policy measures that exist in reality or are under consideration. The presence of actors allows low-stake commercial and domestic decision-making to be embedded within the model and thereby drive system evolution in response to commercial pressures and proposed policy interventions. Model construction is one aspect, but the specifics of policy usage and interpretation are also important. To this end, a technology evaluation issue involving neighborhood fuel cell cogeneration in northern Europe is briefly illustrated with numerical results.

AB  - Low coral islands are heavily dependent on groundwater for freshwater supplies. The availability, quality, and management of groundwater are central to sustainable development and poverty alleviation in many developing small island nations. The declaration by the Government of Kiribati of water reserves on the atoll of Tarawa, over privately owned land, has lead to conflicts, illegal settlements and vandalism of public assets. Beside, the water consumption per capita tends to increase towards western-like standards, threatening the sustainability of the actual exploitation system. Finally, pollution generated by the 45 000 habitants of South Tarawa has already contaminated all the freshwater lenses, with the exception of the existing reserves so far. Our project, called AtollGame, aims at providing the relevant information to the local actors, including institutional and local community representatives in order to facilitate the dialogue and devise together sustainable and equitable water management practices. Multi-Agent Based Simulations (MABS) coupled with a Role-Playing Game have been implemented to fulfil this aim. They have the potential to greatly reduce conflict over natural resource management and resource allocation. In order to collect, understand and merge viewpoints coming from different stakeholders, the following 3-stage methodology is applied: collecting local and expert knowledge, blending the different viewpoints into a game-based model, playing the game with the different stakeholders in order to explore different scenarii and their simulated outcomes. Although game sessions delivered successful outcomes, the final stage of the project is characterised by the upheaval of contradictory Government stands that undermine the whole process. It is argued that heterogeneous viewpoints may be handled in a satisfactory manner during the gaming sessions, but that long-term hidden agendas may override the outcomes. Beyond the inherent question of legitimacy attached to such approaches, it is clear, from our experience, that some players - especially those representing Government or supra-national institutions - have to deal with constraints that are often genuinely first considered as external to the on-going negotiation process.

AB  - Public urban traffic (PUT) requirements are based on the specific characteristics that dictate the requirements themselves. The problems faced by all the big cities regarding public urban transport are very similar, and they range from unacceptability of the very organisational structure of the system facing the population growth, limitations and congestions of the traffic routes loaded by an increasing number of automobiles, to the chronic lack of economic funds for the investments that would create the necessary conditions for positive shifts. In PUT there are many random parameters whose statistical laws are not easy to determine and it is often the topic of research of various profiles of scientists. There is always the satisfaction, that is, the lack of satisfaction by the final user of the public urban transport and all the other involved groups. The result is that the potential users of public urban transport give up and try to find other solutions for their transport needs, turning in principle to individual traffic. Consequently, the number of passenger cars on the traffic routes increases along with all the resulting negative effects. The complex systems of public urban transport facing the increasing requirements to improve efficiency have to be subjected to certain changes in order to achieve physical sustainability of traffic at all, and to satisfy the environmental requirements that occur as counterbalance to the pollution of the urban area. With the aim of achieving optimal conditions for the quality of service, and by introducing acceptable traffic solutions combined with the integrated quality management system based on the standards ISO 9001 and ISO 14000 high-quality shifts are made possible. The integration of these standards results in the rational combining of the quality management system into a single efficient system, reflected in achieving high-quality traffic and transport service, improved information flow, unique documentation, positive orientation to the environment with concurrent reduction in the costs of resources, energy and number of automobiles on the traffic routes.

AB  - The broadening spectrum of environmental problems, the uncertainty regarding their scale and duration, and their possible irreversibility, in the context of the growing social preference for environmental quality, make it necessary to undertake an ex ante approach to the link between productive activity and environmental quality. This link lies in technology, and the right approach is to understand how the process of technological change can lead towards sustainability. The added value of Evolutionary Economics in the context of environmental policy resides mainly in the fact that it warns that certain inferior environmental technologies may be locked in to the economic system. The results of our model show that it would be advisable to undertake policies expressly aimed at the process of sustainable technological change-applying an ex ante (precautionary) approach-in a way that is complementary to the conventional equilibrium oriented environmental policies. The nature of these policies and how they might be implemented are questions we will address from this novel approach to the concept of sustainable development. In short, the main objectives of this paper are to understand more fully the dynamics of the process of technological change, its role in sustainable development, and to assess the implications of this dynamic approach to techno-environmental policy. To achieve these goals we have developed an agent-based model (ABM), using distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) concepts drawn from the general methodology of social simulation. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
