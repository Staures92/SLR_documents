Employing an agent-based model inspired by Sweden's freight sector, we simulate strategies for fleet replacement while considering financial health and balance sheets. Hauliers are portrayed as agents with financial attributes sourced from real-world financial statements. Their financing decisions are informed by pecking order theory. Through a series of scenario tests, we simulate the impacts of policy interventions on hauliers’ transition trajectories. Our findings highlight the challenges associated with integrating electric trucks, attributed to limited financing avenues. Both internal and equity financing are found to be inadequate, while debt financing raises concerns about credit risks. These findings remain robust even when incentives like subsidies and reduced interest rates on loans are introduced. The study underscores the intricate interplay between financial factors and sustainable heavy-duty road transport. © 2024 The Author(s)",Agent-based model; Debt financing; Equity financing; Heavy-duty sector; Internal financing; Sustainability transition,Sweden; Automobiles; Autonomous agents; Autonomous vehicles; Computational methods; Finance; Freight transportation; Risk assessment; Roads and streets; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Debt financing; Equity financing; Hauliers; Heavy duty; Heavy-duty sector; Internal financing; Modeling approach; Road transports; Sustainability transition; debt; finance; financial policy; freight transport; interest rate; modeling; road transport; subsidy system; sustainability; Sustainable development,,,,,"Swedish transportation agency; Swedish Government; Trafikverket, (2020.3.2.11); Trafikverket",Funding text 1: This research was funded by research grants from the Swedish transportation agency and the Swedish Government through the Strategic Research Area.; Funding text 2: This research was funded by research grants through the Triple F research initiative by the Swedish Transport Administration under project number 2020.3.2.11.,"Alonso-Villar A., Davidsdottir B., Stefansson H., Asgeirsson E.I., Kristjansson R., Technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of alternative fuel heavy-duty vehicles in Iceland, J.

However, accurately estimating the first costs of a green project during the early concept development stages is challenging, and effective ways to comprehensively predict potential lifecycle cost impacts of sustainability strategies do not exist. This paper describes a agent-based model (ABM) of the Total Cost of Ownership of green facilities applicable at the earliest stages of concept development. An ABM approach captures the social, environmental, and engineering systems that characterize a facility's life cycle cost. It permits evaluating the impact of the institutional and industry environment on facility life cycle performance, and also captures the cost impacts of tightly coupled facility systems that characterize green design. ©2010 IEEE.",,Costs; Investments; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Agent-based model; Capital facilities; Concept development; Cost impact; Cost saving; Engineering systems; Facility life cycle; Green designs; Industry environment; Lifecycle costs; Operational phase; Sustainability strategies; Technical systems; Tightly-coupled; Total cost of ownership; Stages,,,,,,,"Ahn Y.H., Sustainability Investments for Capital Project Portfolios, (2010); Arditi D.A., Messiha H.M., Life-cycle costing in municipal construction projects, Journal of Infrastructure Systems, 2, 1, pp. 5-14, (1996); Arpke A., Hutzler N., Operational life-cycle assessment and life-cycle cost analysis for water use in multioccupant buildings, Journal of Architectural Engineering, 11, 3, pp. 99-109, (2005); Asiedu Y., Gu P., Product life cycle cost analysis: State of the art review, International Journal of Production Research, 36, 4, pp. 883-908, (1998); Boehm B.W., Software Engineering Economics, (1981); Bennett M., James P., The Green Bottom Line: Environmental Accounting for Management, (1998); Cole R.J., Cost and value in building green, Building Research & Inf., 28, 5-6, pp. 304-309, (2000); Dewick P., Miozzo M., Networks and innovation: Sustainable technologies in Scottish social housing, R and D Management, 34, 3, pp. 323-333, (2004); DuBose J.R., Sustainability As An Inherently Contextual Concept: Some Lessons from Agricultural Development, (1994); The Cost and Benefits of LEED-NC in Colorado, (2006); Fisk W.J., Health and productivity gains from better indoor environments and their relationship with building energy efficiency, Annual Review of Energy and the Environment, 25, pp. 537-566, (2000); Fisk W.J., Estimates of improved productivity and health from better indoor environments, Indoor Air, 7, 3, pp. 158-172, (1997); Gil N., Tommelein I.D., Kirkendall R.L., Ballard G., Contribution of specialty contractor knowledge to early design, Proc.

Interest in sustainable building practices has increased over recent years, but obstacles remain to implementing such practices in public construction projects on a regular basis. A primary stumbling block is the difficulty in generating accurate estimates for total cost of ownership of a facility in the early stages of design. This paper builds on previously published work to describe the prototype implementation of an agent based model to help determine the inputs for cost modeling. © 2011 IEEE.",,Computational methods; Construction industry; Intelligent buildings; Sustainable development; Agent-based model; Capital facilities; Cost modeling; Prototype implementations; Public agencies; Public construction projects; Stumbling blocks; Sustainable building; Total cost of ownership; Cost benefit analysis,,,,,,,"Ahn Y.H., Sustainability Investments for Capital Project Portfolios, (2010); DuBose J.R., Bosch S.J., Pearce A.R., Analysis of Statewide Green Building Policies, Journal of Green Building, 2, 2, pp. 161-177, (2007); High Risk Series: Federal Real Property, (2003); High Risk Series: An Update, (2007); Hawken P., Lovins A.B., Lovins L.H., Natural Capitalism, (1999); Kats G.H., Green Building Costs and Financial Benefits, (2004);  Century, (2004); Pearce A.R., Sustainable Capital Projects: Leapfrogging the First Cost Barrier, Civil Engineering and Environmental Systems, 25, 4, pp. 291-301, (2008); Pearce A.R., Sanford Bernhardt K.L., Garvin M.J., Sustainability and Socio-envirotechnical Systems: Modeling Total Cost of Ownership in Capital Facilities, Proceedings of the 2010 Winter Simulation Conference, pp. 3157-3169, (2010); Building Momentum: National Trends and Prospects for High-Performance, (2003)","K.L.S.

Perhaps not surprising, many governments all around the world are providing incentives for consumers to buy electric vehicles (EVs). A positive response from consumers means that the demand for the charging infrastructure increases as well. We investigate how an existing traditional parking lot, upgraded with chargers, can suit the present demand for charging stations. In particular, a resulting EV-enabled parking lot is an electricity trading agent (i.e., broker) which acts as an energy retailer and as a player on a target electricity market. In this paper, we use agent-based simulation to present the EV-enabled parking lot ecosystem in order to model the underlying dynamics and uncertainties regarding parking lots with electricity trading agent functionalities. We instantiate our agentbased simulations using real-life data in order to perform the what-if analysis. Several key performance indicators (KPIs), including parking utilization, charging utilization and electricity utilization, are proposed. We also illustrate how those KPIs can be used to choose the effective investment strategy with respect to the number and speed of chargers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Agent-based simulation; Electric vehicles; EV-enabled parking lot; Trading agents,Benchmarking; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Power markets; Software agents; Sustainable development; Agent based simulation; Charging infrastructures; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electricity trading; Environmental sustainability; Key performance indicators; Parking lots; Trading agent; Intelligent agents,,,,,"European Commission, EC; European Cooperation in Science and Technology, COST, (IC1404); Hrvatska Zaklada za Znanost, HRZZ, (UIP-11-2013-8813)","The authors acknowledge the support of the research project “Managing Trust and Coordinating Interactions in Smart Networks of People, Machines and Organizations”, funded by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project UIP-11-2013-8813 and COST Action IC1404 on Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems, funded by European Union.

In a macroeconomic perspective, national budget deficits and inadequate policy designs hinder public and private investments in renewable projects. These problems lead governments to borrow a considerable amount of money for sustainable development, although such excessive debt-based financing pushes them to unsustainable economic development. This substantial amount of borrowing makes a negative contribution to the high global debt concentration, putting countries' economic and social development at risk. In line with this, excessive debt-based financing causes an increase in wealth inequality, and when wealth inequality reaches a dramatic level, wars and many other social problems are triggered to correct the course of wealth inequality. In this regard, the motivation behind the study is to develop a set of policy guidelines for sustainable financing models as a solution for these intertwined problems, which are: 1) a financial gap in energy investments; 2) an excessive global debt concentration; and 3) a dramatic increase in wealth inequality. To this end, this study presents a quantitative and comparative proof of concept analysis of alternative financing models in a solar farm investment simulation to investigate the change in wealth inequality and social welfare by reducing debt-based financing and increasing public participation. There are many studies in the literature investigating the evolution of wealth inequality throughout history. However, there is a gap in the literature, and investigating the effects of various policy rules on the evolution of wealth inequality in a future time frame needs to be explored in order to discuss possible policy implications beforehand. In this respect, this paper contributes to the literature by developing simulation models for conventional and alternative financing systems. This enables investigating the changes in wealth inequality and social welfare as a result of various policy implications throughout the simulation time. © 2019 by the authors.",Agent-based modeling; Energy economics; Equity-based financing; Sustainable economics; Sustainable finance,economic conditions; economic development; economics; macroeconomics; modeling; policy approach; public-private partnership; simulation; social development; social participation,,,,,,,"Samouilidis J.-E., Mitropoulos C.S., Energy investment and economic growth, Energy Econ, 5, pp. 237-246, (1983); Munnell A.H., Policy Watch: Infrastructure Investment and Economic Growth, J.

By means of an agent-based computational model, the paper investigates the macro and micro economic dynamics considering the role of a “traditional” commercial bank and a state investment bank that explicitly supports green investments. Simulation results emphasize that green finance matter and that the market diffusion of environmental innovation is more pronounced when the presence of the public investment bank is combined with strong consumers’ preferences oriented towards environmental quality. The relevance of the paper is twofold. Besides contributing to the literature on the finance-innovation nexus by considering the role of climate finance within a complex systems framework, it provides a model that can be used as a tool to explore policies to foster environmental innovation diffusion. © 2018",Agent-based computational economics; Climate finance; Environmental innovation; Industrial dynamics; Innovation diffusion; Public investment banks,,,,,,,,"Acemoglu D., Akcigit U., Hanley D., Kerr W., Transition to clean technology, J.

In this context, a competitive market emerges where multiple oligarchic Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) providers vie for profit. However, analyzing such systems, especially in a long-term rolling horizon, poses significant challenges due to complex strategic interactions among multiple entities. This article proposes an agent-based model to analyze the evolution of spatial CaaS markets. Firstly, we propose a strategic pricing game among CaaS firms based on multinomial logit user choice model, and formally prove the existence of Nash equilibria. For equilibrium finding, an iterative algorithm method leveraging the Nikaido–Isoda function and Barzilai-Borwein step size rule is presented. Furthermore, an agent-based market simulation algorithm is developed to model investment decisions of CaaS firm agents based on equilibrium prices. The proposed model is validated using real world data from Shenzhen, and results indicate the efficacy of the equilibrium solving algorithm in reducing computational burden. This study reveals that deregulated competition among CaaS providers, while promoting social welfare, poses risks to long-term sustainability due to regional inequality and market saturation. Timely policy intervention is recommended to guide the sustainable evolution of the CaaS economy. © 2024 The Authors",Agent-based modeling; Charging-as-a-service; Electric vehicles; Geographic information systems; Spatial pricing competition,,,,,,"Shenzhen Academy of Social Sciences, (SZ2024C009)",This work is sponsored by Shenzhen Academy of Social Sciences under Grant Number SZ2024C009.,"Adler N., Brudner A., Proost S., A review of transport market modeling using game-theoretic principles, Eur.

In this regard, this research investigates social welfare by evaluating the change in wealth inequality for the future time horizon by simulating conventional and the PCP financing models on solar farms in the case study of Turkey. The motivation is to find a solution for financing regional development in a holistic approach considering society and the environment to accomplish sustainable development. Furthermore, it also aims to provide insights into innovative public-private partnerships to unlock new horizons for development by incorporating citizen participation at large. The PCP model's objective is to mobilize capital throughout the public by prioritizing individuals along with small and medium enterprises over the large corporates in fundraising for renewable energy projects, mainly solar farms. This paper provides quantitative evidence that the PCP functions as a sustainable and alternative financing model by dramatically reducing wealth inequality. Besides, the PCP holds the potential to become a self-sufficient financing mechanism for projects ranging from small ones to mega initiatives. © 2021 The Author(s)",Agent-based modeling; Crowdfunding; Philanthropy; Sustainable finance; Turkey; Wealth inequality,Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; Carbon; Crowdsourcing; Energy policy; Mergers and acquisitions; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Citizen participation; Financing mechanisms; Holistic approach; Low carbon energies; Public private partnerships; Regional development; Renewable energy projects; Small and medium enterprise; alternative energy; crowdsourcing; holistic approach; innovation; partnership approach; PCP; public-private partnership; regional development; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; Finance,,,,,Qatar National Library,Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.,"Munnell A.H., Policy watch: infrastructure investment and economic growth, J Econ Perspect, 6, pp. 189-198, (1992); Samouilidis J.-E., Mitropoulos C.S., Energy investment and economic growth, Energy Econ, 5, pp. 237-246, (1983); World energy investment 2019, (2019); Perspectives for the energy transition: investment needs for a low-carbon energy system, Int.

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate policy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then identify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches most frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative, optimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the full-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual influences among agents (multi-agent interactions) and capture related self-reinforcing (positive feedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and path-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent heterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling approach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its use in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption and diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3) interactions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and (4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the proposed methodology is subsequently discussed by reference to four specific applications relating to each of the above areas: the diffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on income and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the cross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. In conclusion, the article calls for a fundamental methodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with that of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the impact of sustainability policies. © 2016 The Authors.",Behavioural sciences; Climate change mitigation; Complexity sciences; Environmental policy assessment,biofuel; climate change; complexity; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental modeling; environmental policy; heterogeneity; methodology; policy analysis; policy making; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; technology adoption,,,,,"Newton Fund; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/K007254/1, EP/N002504/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC, (NE/P015093/1); Natural Environment Research Council, NERC","Funding text 1: The authors wish to thank the full GUIDEPOST team for highly fruitful discussions over the length of funding proposal developments.

Several decades on, relentless economic growth persists at the expense of natural capital, as demonstrated by biodiversity decline, climate change and other environmental challenges. Why is this happening and what can be done about it? We present three agent-based models that explore the social, economic and governance factors driving (un)sustainability in complex social–ecological systems. Our modelling results reinforce the idea that the current economic system fails to safeguard the natural capital upon which it relies, leading to the prevailing decoupling between the economic and natural systems. In attempting to find solutions for such disjunction, our research shows that social–ecological systems are complex, dynamic and non-linear. Interestingly, results also reveal that there are common factors to most social–ecological systems that have the potential to improve or diminish sustainability: the role of financial entities and monetary debt; economic speculation; technological development and efficiency; long-term views, tipping point management and government interventions; and top-down and bottom-up conservation forces. These factors can play a dual role, as they can either undermine or enhance sustainability depending on their specific context and particular conditions. Therefore, the current economic system may not be inherently unsustainable, but rather specific economic mechanisms, decision-making processes and the complex links between economic and natural systems could be at the root of the problem. We argue that short- and medium-term sustainability can be achieved by implementing mechanisms that shift capitalist forces to support environmental conservation. Long-term sustainability, in contrast, requires a more profound paradigm shift: the full integration and accounting of externalities and natural capital into the economy. © 2024 by the authors.",agent-based model; biodiversity; ecosystem services; natural capital; social–ecological system; sustainability,biodiversity; climate change; decision making; economic growth; economic system; environmental modeling; government; natural capital; sustainability; sustainable development; technological development,,,,,"James Hutton Institute (Aberdeen, UK); University of Dundee; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO","This work was supported by the James Hutton Institute (Aberdeen, UK), the University of Dundee (UK) and the CSIRO—Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (Cairns, Australia).

However, if private debt consistently grows faster than GDP, the consequences are financial crises and the current unprecedented level of global debt. This policy dilemma is aggravated by the lack of analy-ses factoring the impact of debt-growth cycles on the environment. What is really the relationship between debt and natural resource sustainability, and what is the role of debt in decoupling economic growth from natural resource availability? Here we present a conceptual Agent-Based Model (ABM) that integrates an environmental system into an ABM representation of Steve Keen’s debt-based economic models. Our model explores the extent to which debt-driven processes, within debt-based economies, enhance the decoupling between economic growth and the availability of natural resources. Interestingly, environmental and economic collapse in our model are not caused by debt growth, or the debt-based nature of the economic system itself (i.e. the ‘what’), but rather, these are due to the inappropriate use of debt by private actors (i.e. the ‘how’). Firms inappropriately use bank credits for speculative goals–rather than production-oriented ones–and for exponentially increasing rates of technological development. This context creates temporal mismatches between natural resource growth and firms’ resource extraction rates, as well as between economic growth and the capacity of the government to effectively implement natural resource conservation policies. This paper discusses the extent to which economic growth and the availability of natural resources can be re-coupled through a more sustainable use of debt, for instance by shifting mainstream banking forces to partially support environmental conservation as well as economic growth. © 2018 Gonzalez-Redin et al.

For this purpose, we consider an enriched version of the Eurace model, which includes heterogenous capital goods, allowing for different degrees of energy efficiency in the production technology. Credit money in Eurace is endogenous and limited by Basel capital adequacy regulation on the supply side, while on the demand side it is determined by firms’ investments and households’ house purchasing. We introduce a differentiation of capital requirements according to the destination of lending, demanding higher bank capital in the case of speculative lending, thus encouraging banks to finance firm investment. As up-to-date capital goods have better energy efficiency in the model design, a higher pace of investment implies also a positive environmental effect. Results suggest that the proposed regulation is able to foster investments and capital accumulation in the short term, improving the energy efficiency of firms. However, reducing mortgages with a restrictive regulation has a negative impact on total private credit, and thus on endogenous money supply, weakening consumption and aggregate demand. In the long term, the contraction of total credit becomes stronger, and the negative outcomes on aggregate demand also affect investment. Therefore, in the long run, the positive effects on capital and energy efficiency become negligible, while the main economic indicators deteriorate. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agent-based modeling;

The model describes relevant feedback mechanisms between technological evolution, the interbank market and the electricity sector. Analysis with it shows that energy policies affect interbank connectivity and hence the likelihood of cascades of bank failures. This effect has not been studied before in the literature. In particular, we find that investments in renewable energy reduce interbank connectivity, increasing the probability of bank failures, while raising taxes on energy has an opposite effect. Increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity production initially increases the price of electricity, and thus improves profits and the ability to re-pay debts of incumbent power plants. However, when the share of renewable energy increases too quickly, financial stability may be at stake as the burden of financing investments in renewable energy offsets the improved profitability of existing power stations. All in all, this study provides a unique and novel perspective on the relationship between renewable energy investments and financial stability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Complexity; Financial stability; Renewable energy; Sustainability transitions,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Energy policy; Finance; Profitability; Stability; Complexity; Electricity production; Electricity sector; Financial stability; Renewable energies; Renewable energy investments; Sustainability transition; Technological evolution; complexity; electricity supply; energy policy; finance; investment; renewable resource; sustainability; tax system; Investments,,,,,,,"Allen F., Gale D., Financial contagion, J.

Despite global debt reaching unprecedented levels, little research has been done to understand the impacts of debt dynamics on environmental sustainability. Here, we explore the environmental impacts of the debt-growth cycle in Indonesia, the world’s largest debt-based producer of palm oil. Our empirical Agent-Based Model analyses the future effects (2018–2050) of power (im)balance scenarios between debt-driven economic forces (i.e. banks, firms), and conservation forces, on two ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation) and biodiversity. The model shows the trade-offs and synergies among these indicators for Business As Usual as compared to alternative scenarios. Results show that debt-driven economic forces can partially support environmental conservation, provided the state’s role in protecting the environment is reinforced. Our analysis provides a lesson for developing countries that are highly dependent on debt-based production systems: sustainable development pathways can be achievable in the short and medium terms; however, reaching long-term sustainability requires reduced dependency on external financial powers, as well as further government intervention to protect the environment from the rough edges of the market economy. © 2019, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",Agent-based model; Debt; Ecosystem services; Palm oil; Social–ecological system; Sustainable development,Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Indonesia; Palm Oil; Indonesia; palm oil; biodiversity; conservation status; developing world; ecological economics; economic growth; ecosystem service; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; government; market conditions; oil production; sustainability; sustainable development; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; Indonesia,,"palm oil, 8002-75-3; Palm Oil, ",,,"James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, UK; Postgraduate School; University of Dundee","This work was partially supported by the Postgraduate School at the James Hutton Institute, Aberdeen, UK.

This study explores the impact of a financing scheme on company performance during business growth, since new banking constraints for credit risk reduction have been introduced (such as BASEL III regulations). Based on qualitative and quantitative data from a longitudinal empirical case study of a Swiss family-owned SME during a phase of intense growth, we have built a simulation model by combining agent-based with system dynamics modelling that comprehensively represents the growing firm, its decision-making, and enables the impact evaluation of relevant financial KPIs on financial sustainability. Our analysis shows that the baseline scenario entails 80% risk of bankruptcy for high-growth SMEs; featuring 30 days customer accounts receivable flow time target and a credit limit allowed by the financial partner of 25% of last period turnover. However, if customer accounts receivable flow time is reduced to ten days, and credit limit increased to 65% of last turnover, the risk of bankruptcy drops to 30%. Our findings point to the detrimental unanticipated side effects of macro-level banking regulation on micro-level firm performance, and hence have implications for policy-making. Moreover, our study guides managers and financial service providers in anticipating risky situations, and in taking corrective actions by effectively managing financial KPIs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based simulation; Business growth management; Decision-making; Sustainability; System-dynamics,Benchmarking; Decision making; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sales; Sustainable development; System theory; Agent based simulation; Business growth; Empirical case studies; Financial sustainability; Key performance indicators; Small and medium-sized enterprise; System Dynamics; System dynamics modelling; Finance,,,,,,,"Achtenhagen L., Naldi L., Melin L., Business growth—do practitioners and scholars really talk about the same thing?, Enterpren.

It has recently become possible to quantify SR in terms of underlying financial networks where nodes represent financial institutions, and links capture the size and maturity of assets (loans), liabilities and other obligations, such as derivatives. We demonstrate that it is possible to quantify the share of SR that individual liabilities within a financial network contribute to the overall SR. We use empirical data of nationwide interbank liabilities to show that the marginal contribution to overall SR of liabilities for a given size varies by a factor of a thousand. We propose a tax on individual transactions that is proportional to their marginal contribution to overall SR. If a transaction does not increase SR, it is tax-free. With an agent-based model (ABM) (CRISIS macro-financial model), we demonstrate that the proposed ‘Systemic Risk Tax’ (SRT) leads to a self-organized restructuring of financial networks that are practically free of SR. The SRT can be seen as an insurance for the public against costs arising from cascading failure. ABM predictions are shown to be in remarkable agreement with the empirical data and can be used to understand the relation of credit risk and SR. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Agent-based modelling; Banking regulation; DebtRank; Financial transactions taxes; Network optimization; Resilience; Self-organization; Sustainability; Systemic risk,,,,,,"MULTIPLEX; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (317532, 318132, 288501)","We acknowledge financial support from EC FP7 projects CRISIS, agreement no.

However, traditional climate economics and financial risk models are not properly equipped to consider the characteristics of climate risks and the opportunities from climate-alignment, being constrained by equilibrium conditions and linearity of impacts, as well as by representative agents and intertemporal optimization. Given the closing window of opportunity to achieve the 2 °C target, there is an urgent need for a new wave of models able to embrace uncertainty and complexity deriving not only from climate impacts on socio-economic systems, but also from their reaction. In this regard, approaches rooted on evolutionary economics and complexity science could provide complementary insights to traditional climate economics models. This special issue contributes to fill in this knowledge gap by collecting nine papers applying evolutionary and complex systems approaches, and agent-based and network models to climate change economics, presented at the Special Session of the Research Area “Environment-Economics Interactions” of the European Association of Evolutionary Political Economy (EAEPE)'s conference 2016. By introducing conceptual and methodological innovations in climate economics and finance, the nine articles analyse the conditions for effective climate policies and financial instruments to align countries to the global climate targets, compared to the costs of inaction. This information is crucial to support decision-makers in the analysis of climate-finance policies and instruments to foster the transition to a sustainable and inclusive low-carbon economy. © 2019",Agent-based models; Climate finance; Climate policy; Complex systems; Evolutionary economics; Network models; Uncertainty,climate change; climate effect; complexity; cost analysis; ecological economics; economic instrument; economics; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental risk; global climate; network analysis; policy making; uncertainty analysis,,,,,"Centre for Research on Energy Demand Solutions, (EP/R035288/1); European Union FP7; Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, University of Leeds, CCCEP; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC, (ES/K006576/1); Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; UK Energy Research Centre, UKERC, (EP/L024756/1); UK Energy Research Centre, UKERC; European Commission, EC, (603416); European Commission, EC; Horizon 2020, (640772, 649186); Horizon 2020","Funding text 1: I.M., A.R., T.J.F. thank the EAEPE and the local organizers of the EAEPE conference in Manchester (UK) for the support with the organization of the special session, the anonymous reviewers of the nine manuscripts, and the Ecological Economics editorial board for their precious help and support with the management of this special issue.

However, identification of the desired scenarios for the closure of the financing gap is complex because there are many factors that affect investment in infrastructure. Thus, comprehensive models are required to (1) simulate the impacts of policies, and (2) identify the highly likely scenarios for desired policy outcomes. The objective of this paper is to create a simulation model for ex-ante analysis of financing policies in highway transportation infrastructure in the United States. Using the agent-based technique, this model simulates the microbehaviors of state Departments of Transportation, private institutional investors, and the public. Using the output of the simulation model, financing landscapes of the U.S. transportation infrastructure are developed. The simulated landscape is shown to be helpful in identifying the highly likely scenarios leading to a high level of investment in highway transportation infrastructure under the existing infrastructure investment structures and budget constraints in the United States. The study presented in this paper is novel with respect to (1) the application of the system-of-systems modeling in the analysis of transportation infrastructure financing policies, (2) identification of the desired policy scenarios and their likelihoods for closure of the financing gap in the presence of uncertainties and adaptive behaviors, and (3) simulation and visualization of the impacts of financing policies at the state and national levels. The model promotes a data-driven policy analysis and provides policymakers with a tool to simultaneously account for the impacts of several factors and uncertainties. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Agent-based modeling; Complexity; Ex-ante policy analysis; Financing; Infrastructure; Metamodeling; Sustainability; System of systems,Autonomous agents; Budget control; Computational methods; Finance; Motor transportation; Sustainable development; System of systems; Systems engineering; Transportation; Uncertainty analysis; Agent-based model; Complexity; Financing; Infrastructure; Metamodeling; Policy analysis; Investments,,,,,,,"Report Card for America's Infrastructure, (2013); Ashley D., Bauman R., Carroll J., Diekmann J., Finlayson F., Evaluating viability of privatized transportation projects, J.

To this purpose, we employ an enriched version of the agent-based Eurace macroeconomic model, where we have included an energy sector with a fossil-fuel power producer as well as a renewable-energy based one. Both power producers take pricing and capacity investment decisions based on the price of imported fossil fuel and the feed-in tariff government policy. Results show that the feed-in tariff policy is effective in fostering the sustainability transition of the energy sector and that it increases the level of investments with a positive impact on the unemployment rates. Moreover, we observe that its financing costs do not impact government finances, which actually improve following the better economic conditions. For high policy intensity, however, we observe an increasing GDP share of the investment sector in the economy, due to the building-up of renewable production capacity, with a resulting crowding out of consumption, higher interest rates and prices. The final outcome on household well-being therefore depends on what extent the chosen value judgment recognizes the importance of an economically and ecologically sustainable growth path. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based modeling; Energy sector; Feed-in tariff; Sustainability transition,decision making; economic activity; economic conditions; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; fossil fuel; government; Gross Domestic Product; investment; modeling; policy approach; power generation; price dynamics; renewable resource; sustainability; unemployment,,,,,"European Commission, EC; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (611875)","The authors acknowledge EU-FP7 collaborative project SYMPHONY 16 16 under grant no. 611875.

Recent evidence on the significant impacts of climate change and natural disasters on firms, banks and other financial institutions call for a prompt policy response. In this paper, we employ a macro-financial agent-based model to study the interaction between climate change, credit and economic dynamics and test a mix of policy interven-tions. We first show that financial constraints exacerbate the impact of climate shocks on the economy while, at the same time, climate damages to firms make the banking sector more prone to crises. We find that credit provision can both increase firms' productivity and their financial fragility, with such a trade-off being exacerbated by the effects of climate change. We then test a set of green finance policies addressing these risks, while fostering climate change mitigation: i) green Basel-type capital requirements, ii) green public guarantees to credit, and iii) carbon-risk adjustment in credit ratings. All the policies reduce carbon emissions and the resulting climate impacts, though moderately. However, their effects on financial and real dynamics is not straightforwardly positive. Some combinations of policies fuel credit booms, exacerbating financial instability and increasing public debt. We show that the combination of the three policies leads to a virtuous cycle of (mild) emission reductions, stable financial sector and high economic growth. Additional tools would be needed to fully adapt to climate change. Hence, our results point to the need to complement financial policies cooling down climate-related risks with mitigation policies curbing emissions from real economic activities.

An analysis of how energy efficiency policies impact macroeconomic dynamics occurs through agent-based modeling (ABM). This research evaluates two approaches to sustainable economic development by studying tax incentives as indirect measures and public research laboratory R&D investments as direct measures. The implemented research and development-focused energy efficiency policies create superior environmental benefits while preserving economic stability, according to research results. The study demonstrates why carefully planned government policies are essential for sustainable ecological development and economic stability. The research data provides crucial knowledge for government officials who need practical guidance for merging energy efficiency strategies into economic planning systems. This research expands knowledge about energy efficiency relationships between the environment and the economy while offering directions for additional study on the multiple connections between energy use and economic stability and environmental objectives. © 2025 The Authors",Agent-based modeling; Energy efficiency; Green finance; Macroeconomic stability; Policy implications; Sustainability,Environmental impact; Environmental management systems; Environmental regulations; Green development; Green economy; Agent-based model; Economic growths; Economic stability; Efficiency measure; Energy; Energy efficiency policies; Green finance; Macroeconomic dynamics; Macroeconomic stability; Policy implications; Energy economics,,,,,,,"Tian S., Wang S., Bai X., Luo G., Li Q., Yang Y., Hu Z., Li C., Deng Y., Global patterns and changes of carbon emissions from land use during 1992–2015, Environ.

Specifically, using the elements of network theory, we constructed an agent-based model that obeys the stylized rules of microfinance industry. We found that in a deteriorating economic environment confounded with adverse selection, a form of latent moral hazard may cause a regime shift from a high to a low loan payment probability. An after-the-fact recovery, when possible, required the economic environment to improve beyond that which led to the shift in the first place. These findings suggest a small set of measurable quantities for mapping microfinance credit risk and, consequently, for balancing the requirements to reasonably price loans and to operate on a fully self-financed basis. We illustrate how the proposed mapping works using a 10-year monthly data set from one of the best-known microfinance representatives, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Finally, we discuss an entirely new perspective for managing microfinance credit risk based on enticing spontaneous cooperation by building social capital. © 2015 Lee et al.",,"Bangladesh; Developing Countries; Financial Management; Financial Statements; Humans; Income; Models, Theoretical; Poverty; Risk; Socioeconomic Factors; Article; conceptual framework; credit risk; data analysis; dynamics; economic aspect; finance; financial management; loan payment; mathematical computing; mathematical model; microfinance; risk; social capital; Bangladesh; developing country; financial management; financial statement; human; income; poverty; risk; socioeconomics; theoretical model",,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS, (13F03380, 15H04423); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS",,"Morduch J., The microfinance promise, J Econ Lit, 37, pp. 1569-1614, (1999); Copestake J., Bhalotra S., Johnson S., Assessing the impact of microcredit: A Zambian case study, J Dev Stud, 37, pp. 81-100, (2001); Khandker S.R., Microfinance and poverty: Evidence using panel data from Bangladesh, World Bank Econ Rev, 19, pp. 263-286, (2005); Hermes N., Lensink R., Microfinance: Its impact, outreach, and sustainability, World Dev, 39, pp. 875-881, (2011); Karlan D., Zinman J., Expanding credit access: Using randomized supply decisions to estimate the impacts, Rev Financ Stud, 23, pp. 433-464, (2010); Marr A., A challenge to the orthodoxy concerning microfinance and poverty reduction, J Microfinance, 5, pp. 7-42, (2003); Elahi K.Q., Danopoulos C.P., Microfinance and third world development: A critical analysis, J Polit Mil Soc, 32, pp. 61-78, (2004); Hermes N., Lensink R., The empirics of microfinance: What do we know?, Econ J, 117, pp. F1-F10, (2007); Conning J., Outreach, sustainability and leverage in monitored and peer-monitored lending, J Dev Econ, 60, pp. 51-77, (1999); McIntosh C., Wydick B., Competition and microfinance, J Dev Econ, 78, pp. 271-298, (2005); Mersland R., Strom R.O., Microfinance mission drift?, World Dev, 38, pp. 28-36, (2010); Dehejia R., Montgomery H., Morduch J., Do interest rates matter?

In this regard, the AB-SFC modeling method presents promising opportunities for analyzing and assessing the dynamics of social security systems. This research investigates the possibilities of utilizing the AB-SFC modeling method to develop an efficient financial-investment model for addressing poverty and income inequality in social security provision. By employing the AB-SFC approach, which combines agent-based modeling (ABM) with stock-flow-consistent (SFC) modeling, this study aims to enhance the accuracy and realism of financial simulations in social security systems. Through an analysis of poverty and income inequality within the population, this research examines how the AB-SFC modeling method can contribute to understanding and mitigating these socioeconomic challenges. This study investigates the capabilities of the AB-SFC modeling method in capturing the key features of social security, including contributions, benefits, investments, and demographic factors, while accounting for the dynamic interactions among households, government entities, and financial institutions. This study provides valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of AB-SFC modeling and offers recommendations for policymakers to design effective strategies for reducing poverty and income inequality within the context of social security. The findings highlight the value of the AB-SFC modeling method in constructing an efficient financial-investment model for social security and provide insights into its potential applications in enhancing the ESG sustainability and effectiveness of social security systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",AB-SFC modeling; Agent-based modeling; Financial regulation; Income inequality; Poverty; Social policy; Stock-flow consistent analysis,,,,,,,,"Ai R., Zheng Y., Yuksel S., Dincer H., Investigating the components of fintech ecosystem for distributed energy investments with an integrated quantum spherical decision support system, Financial Innovation, 9, 1, (2023); Aksoy T., Yuksel S., Dincer H., Hacioglu U., Mikhaylov A., Muyeen S.M., Assessing the electricity production capacities of emerging markets for the sustainable investment, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 24574-24590, (2023); Alwaelya S.A., Yousif N.B.A., Mikhaylov A., Emotional development in preschoolers and socialization, Early Child Development and Care, 191, (2021); An J., Mikhaylov A., Russian energy projects in South Africa, Journal of Energy in Southern Africa, 31, 3, pp. 58-64, (2020); An J., Mikhaylov A., Analysis of energy projects financial efficiency and renewable energy generation in Russia, Finance: Theory and Practice, 25, 5, pp. 79-91, (2021); An J., Mikhaylov A., Technology-based forecasting approach for recognizing trade-off between time-to-market reduction and devising a scheduling process in open innovation management, Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity, 10, 1, (2024); An J., Mikhaylov A., Moiseev N., Oil price predictors: Machine learning approach, International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy, 9, 5, pp. 1-6, (2019); An J., Mikhaylov A., Sokolinskaya N., Machine learning in economic planning: Ensembles of algorithms, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1353, (2019); An J., Mikhaylov A., Jung S.-U., The strategy of South Korea in the global oil market, Energies, 13, 10, (2020); An J., Mikhaylov A., Kim K., Machine learning approach in heterogeneous group of algorithms for transport safety-critical system, Applied Sciences, 10, 8, (2020); An J., Mikhaylov A., Richter U.H., Trade war effects: Evidence from sectors of energy and resources in Africa, Heliyon, 6, (2020); An J., Mikhaylov A., Jung S.-U., A linear programming approach for robust network revenue management in the airline industry, Journal of Air Transport Management, 91, (2021); An J., Mikhaylov A., Dincer H., Yuksel S., Economic modelling of electricity generation: Long short-term memory and Q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, Heliyon, 8, (2022); Badr A.M.N.A.A., Mohamed T.I., Osman N.A.Q., Mikhaylov A., A review of social media website users’ interaction paths with governmental accounts during the COVID-19 pandemic, Informatics, 9, (2022); Barykin S., Mikheev A., Kiseleva E., Putikhin Y., Alekseeva N., Mikhaylov A., An empirical analysis of Russian regions’ debt sustainability, Economies, 10, 4, (2022); Barykin S.E., Kapustina I.V., Sergeev S.M., Daniali S.M., Kopteva L.A., Semenova G.N., Pryadko I.P., Mikhaylov A., Baboshkin P., Datsyuk P., Senjyu T., Financial logistics models based on systematic approach improving management solutions, F1000research, 11, (2022); Bhuiyan M.A., An J., Mikhaylov A., Moiseev N., Danish M.S.S., Renewable energy deployment and COVID-19 measures for sustainable development, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Bhuiyan M.A., Dincer H., Yuksel S., Mikhaylov A., Danish M.S.S., Pinter G., Uyeh D.D., Stepanova D., Economic indicators and bioenergy supply in developed economies: QROF-DEMATEL and random forest models, Energy Reports, 8, pp. 561-570, (2022); Bhuiyan M.A., Zhang Q., Khare V., Mikhaylov A., Pinter G., Huang X., Renewable energy consumption and economic growth nexus—A systematic literature review, Frontiers in Environmental Science, 10, (2022); Caiani A., Russo A., Gallegati M., Does Inequality Hamper Innovation and Growth?

Investments have to be collected on the private as well as public sides taking into account the stakeholders’ macro-economic framework. Since aggregate mathematical models, assuming informed, rational behaviour leading to equilibrium conditions cannot catch the resulting complexity, an agent-based modelling and simulation approach is proposed to investigate policies to support investments in resource efficiency. The EURACE agent-based framework has been adopted and modified by coupling the environmental sector with other established macroeconomic dimensions. The findings of this research establish the potential and capability of the proposed approach for investigating policies for sustainability transition analysis and evaluation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Agent based model; Economics; Industrial sustainability; Resource efficiency investments,,,,,,,,"Evans S., Et al., Towards a Sustainable Industrial System, (2009); Tonelli F., Evans S., Taticchi P., Industrial sustainability: Challenges, perspectives, actions, Int.

It is important to achieve sustainable and balanced development for green finance. In this paper, an evolutionary game model is built with four participants, which include governments, financial institutions, enterprises, and consumers. Analogue simulation is applied to analyze the influences of each parameter on changes and development in green financial market. Equilibrium strategy and influence mechanism of participating entities are investigated. The result shows that: first, the integrity of the green financial system has a positive impact on sustainability developments and cleaner production. Second, it is critical to strengthen the government regulation, slash financial institutions and enterprises’ green finance production cost, increase the compensation for consumer pollution, and reduce the supervision cost of government. Accordingly, to integrity green financial system, governments, financial institutions, enterprises, and consumers needs participation and cooperation among each other. © 2020",Evolutionary game; Green financial; Micro participants; Simulation; Sustainability,Climate change; Electronic trading; Energy security; Multi agent systems; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Cleaner production; Equilibrium strategy; Evolutionary game models; Financial institution; Government regulation; Influence mechanism; Innovation capacity; Multi-agent games; Costs,,,,,"Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology; Department of Science and Technology, Hubei Provincial People's Government, (18456214D); Department of Science and Technology, Hubei Provincial People's Government",Funding text 1: This work was supported by the Innovation Capacity Improvement Program of Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology (18456214D).; Funding text 2: This work was supported by the Innovation Capacity Improvement Program of Hebei Provincial Department of Science and Technology ( 18456214D ). ,"Aronowitz E., Weinberg D., The utilization of reinforcement theory in social group work practice, Soc.

However, each actor will attempt to obtain the highest reward. In this study the authors designed a model to simulate the interaction and negotiation behaviors of the actors, and to facilitate optimum distribution of the added value, while considering the successive investment and operational risk levels. Agentbased modeling approach was used for this purpose as it provided the best means to identify and study the supply chain actors (or agents) behaviors. Netlogo software was used to develop the program. This study is important because the model can facilitate further development of various formula to calculate the fair distribution of added value among the actors, therefore ensure the supply chain sustainability. The result of this study indicated that the negotiation between all actors in POSC need to consider overall supply chain sustainability while conducting pairwise negotiation, otherwise the supply chain continuity may be endangered. © ExcelingTech Pub.",Agent based modeling; Business negotiation; Investment level; Netlogo software; Operational risks level,,,,,,,,"Atkin, Rinehart, Effect of Negotiation Practices on Suppliers and Customers, Negotiation Journal January 2006, pp. 47-65, (2006); Awal S., Strategi Penyediaan Karbohidrat Bersumber Dari Ubi Kayu, PhD Thesis, (2012); Bandini S., Manzoni S., Vizzari G., Agent Based Modeling and Simulation: An Informatics Perspective, Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 12, 4, (2009); Bunte F., Pricing And Performance In Agri-Food Supply Chains First Edition, LEI, Wageningen University and Research Centre, pp. 37-45, (2006); LAPORAN AUDIT Audit CAO atas IFC.

This paper extends an electricity agent based model to capture the inter-dependence of consistent governance with underpinning societal pressure and resultant investment strategies. Results show only with the strongest level of governance – reflected in the range of national/local policy mechanisms used, and their strength/timing when interim targets are met/missed – can near-zero electricity emissions be met well before 2050. Strong governance can also ensure a stable electricity system, with consistent policies mitigating the intensity of any investment cycles. Strong governance entails higher capital investments, but these can deliver lower electricity prices in the long-term. And strong governance means that a successful electricity decarbonisation does not need to be built solely on existing incumbents, but also via local cooperatives to aggregate household financing and demand side management. However, with inconsistent governance, a vicious cycle ensues with a weak rationale to enact ambitious policies at both the local and national levels, significant inertia in new electricity investments, and hence “failure” scenarios of decarbonisation. This challenges the prior findings of optimistic achievement of electricity decarbonisation scenarios by standard techno-economic optimisation models. © 2023 The Authors",Agent-based modelling; Electricity transition; Governance; Policy stability; Societal pressure; Virtuous cycles,,,,,,"Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Natural Environment Research Council, NERC; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/S029575/1)","This work was supported through the UK Energy Research Centre Phase 4 (co-funded by NERC , EPSRC and ESRC ) under grant agreement EP/S029575/1 .

However, this is not as simple as instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing them with renewable sources - careful decisions need to be taken to ensure rapid but stable progress. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool, ElecSim, which is an open-sourced agent-based modelling framework used to examine the effect of policy on long-term investment decisions in electricity generation. ElecSim allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas. Different techniques to model long-term electricity decisions are reviewed and used to motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic tool for policy. We motivate why an open-source toolkit is required for long-term electricity planning. Actual electricity prices are compared with our model and we demonstrate that the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation in the system improves performance by 52:5%. Further, using ElecSim we demonstrate the effect of a carbon tax to encourage a low-carbon electricity supply. We show how a £40 ($50) per tonne of CO2 emitted would lead to 70% renewable electricity by 2050. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",,Autonomous agents; Carbon; Climate change; Computational methods; Decision making; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Intelligent systems; Investments; Monte Carlo methods; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Electricity generation; Electricity prices; Fossil fuel energy; Long-term investment; Low-carbon electricities; Renewable electricity; Smart power grids,,,,,,,"Batten D., Grozev G., Nemsim: Finding ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions using multi-agent electricity modelling, Complex Science for A Complex World, pp. 227-252, (2006); Bohringer C., The synthesis of bottom-up and top-down in energy policy modeling, Energy Economics, 20, 3, pp. 233-248, (1998); BP Statistical Review of World Energy, pp. 1-56, (2018); Chappin L E.J., Vries De L.J., Richstein J.C., Bhagwat P., Iychettira K., Khan S., Simulating climate and energy policy with agent-based modelling: The energy modelling laboratory (emlab), Environmental Modelling and Software, 96, pp. 421-431, (2017); Cincotti S., Gallo G., Berkeley L., The Genoa Artificial Power-Exchange the Genoa Artificial Power-exchange, (2013); Conzelmann G., Boyd G., Koritarov V., Veselka T., Multi-agent power market simulation using EMCAS, IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting, pp. 917-922, (2005); Cook J., Nuccitelli D., Green S.A., Richardson M., Winkler B., Painting R., Peter Jacobs R., Skuce A., Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature, Environ.

In this paper, we construct an agent-based network model of systemic risk to a banking system, and use it for stress-testing of several different regulatory measures. First, our simulations confirm that sufficient capital buffers in individual banks are crucial for protecting the stability of the whole system. Second, we show that the regulatory measures installed as preventive measures to ensure that the banks possess sufficient capital buffers have almost no positive effects on stability when the system is collapsing. Finally, we highlight various data deficiencies which prevent the researchers and regulators from fully understanding the complete range of systemic risk and make it difficult to devise effective and targeted regulatory measures at this time. © 2014 University of Economics - Prague.

In complex socio-economic systems this kind of behavior leads to self-organization, which may be both desirable (e.g. social cooperation) and undesirable (e.g. mass panic, financial “bubbles” or “crashes”). Abundance of the empirical data as well as general insights into the trading behavior enables the creation of simple agent-based models reproducing sophisticated statistical features of the financial markets. In this contribution we consider a possibility to prevent self-organized extreme events in financial market modeling its behavior using agent-based herding model, which reproduces main stylized facts of the financial markets. We show that introduction of agents with predefined fundamentalist trading behavior helps to significantly reduce the probability of the extreme price fluctuations events. We also investigate random trading, which was previously found to be promising extreme event prevention strategy, and find that its impact on the market has to be considered among other opportunities to stabilize the markets. © 2015, EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Statistical and Nonlinear Physics,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Crashworthiness; Electronic trading; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Agent-based model; Prevention strategies; Price fluctuation; Self organizations; Social cooperations; Socio-economic systems; Statistical and Nonlinear Physics; Statistical features; Finance,,,,,,,"Bouchaud J.P., Potters M., Theory of Financial Risks and Derivative Pricing, (2004); Chakraborti A., Toke I.M., Patriarca M., Abergel F., Quant.

Methods for the quantification of flood risk are well established, but tend to deal with human and economic vulnerability as being static or changing with an exogenously defined trend. In this paper we present an Agent-Based Model (ABM) developed to simulate the dynamical evolution of flood risk and vulnerability, and facilitate an investigation of insurance mechanism in London. The ABM has been developed to firstly allow an analysis of the vulnerability of homeowners to surface water flooding, which is one of the greatest short-term climate risks in the UK with estimated annual costs of £1.3bn to £2.2bn. These costs have been estimated to increase by 60-220% over the next 50 years due to climate change and urbanisation. Vulnerability is influenced by home-owner’s decisions to move house and/or install measures to protect their properties from flooding. In particular, the ABM focuses on the role of flood insurance, simulating the current public-private partnership between the government and insurers in the UK, and the forthcoming re-insurance scheme Flood Re, designed as a roadmap to support the future affordability and availability of flood insurance. The ABM includes interaction between homeowners, sellers and buyers, an insurer, a local government and a developer. Detailed GIS and qualitative data of the London borough of Camden are used to represent an area at high risk of surface water flooding. The ABM highlights how future development can exacerbate current levels of surface water flood risk in Camden. Investment in flood protection measures are shown to be beneficial for reducing surface water flood risk. The Flood Re scheme is shown to achieve its aim of securing affordable flood insurance premiums, however, is placed under increasing pressure in the future as the risk of surface water flooding continues to increase. © 2017, University of Surrey.

We propose to classify the extent to which an ABM is data-driven based on whether agent-level quantities are initialized from real-world micro-data and whether the ABM’s dynamics track empirical time series. This paper discusses how making ABMs data-driven helps overcome limitations of traditional ABMs and makes ABMs a stronger alternative to equilibrium mod els. We review state-of-the-art methods in parameter calibration, initialization, and data assimilation, and then present successful applications that have generated new scientific knowledge and informed policy decisions. This paper serves as a manifesto for data-driven ABMs, introducing a definition and classification and outlining the state of the field, and as a guide for those new to the field.",,,,,,,,,,,,Santa Fe Institute Press,,,,,,,,,,English,,Book chapter,Preprint (arXiv),No,,

Despite the existence of different attempts to link the economy (or parts of it) to the evolution of the climate, results have often been disappointing and criticized. In this paper, we discuss the use of agent-based modeling for climate policy integrated assessment. First, we identify the main limitations of current mainstream models and stress how framing the problem from a complex system perspective might help, in particular when extreme climate conditions are at stake and general equilibrium effects are questionable. Second, we present two agent-based models that serve as prototypes for the analysis of coupled climate, energy, and macroeconomic dynamics. We argue that such models constitute examples of a promising approach for the integrated assessment of climate change and economic dynamics. They allow a bottom-up representation of climate damages and their cross-sectoral percolation, naturally embed distributional issues, and traditionally account for the role of finance in sustaining economic development and shaping the dynamics of energy transitions. All these issues are at the fore-front of the research in integrated assessment. Finally, we provide a careful discussion of testable policy exercises, modeling limitations, and open challenges for this stream of research. Notwithstanding great potential, there is a long way-to-go for agent-based models to catch-up with the richness of many existing integrated assessment models and overcome their major problems. This should encourage research in the area. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Agent-based models; Climate change; Climate policy; Integrated assessment; Transitions,,,,,,"European Union 7th FP; European Commission, EC; Parthenope University; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7, (610704, 603416); Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (649186, 640772); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020","Acknowledgements The authors express their gratitude to two anonymous referees whose comments improved the quality of the paper.

This paper describes the ensuing agent-based model for analyzing the vulnerability of the financial system to asset- and funding-based fire sales. The model captures the dynamic interactions of agents in the financial system extending from the suppliers of funding through the intermediation and transformation functions of the bank/dealers to the financial institutions that use the funds to trade in the asset markets. The model replicates the key finding that it is the reaction to initial losses, rather than the losses themselves, that determine the extent of a crisis. By building on a detailed mapping of the transformations and dynamics of the financial system, the agent-based model provides an avenue toward risk management that can illuminate the pathways for the propagation of key crisis dynamics such as fire sales and funding runs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).",Agent-based models; Contagion; Financial intermediation; Financial networks; Macroprudential; Stress testing,,,,,,,,"Acharya V.V., Gromb D., Yorulmazer T., Imperfect competition in the interbank market for liquidity as a rationale for central banking, Macroecon Am Econ J, 4, 2, pp. 184-217, (2012); Adrian T., Shin H.S., Liquidity and leverage, J Financ Intermed, 19, 3, pp. 418-437, (2010); Adrian T., Shin H.S., Pro-cyclical leverage and value-at-risk, Rev Financ Stud, 27, 2, pp. 373-403, (2014); Battiston S., Puliga M., Kaushik R., Tasca P., Caldarelli G., Debtrank: Too central to fail?

It focuses on the interactions of agents and on how these interactions feed back to change the financial environment. It explains how these models embody the contagion and cascades that occur owing to the financial leverage and market concentration of the agents and the liquidity of the markets. This article also compares agent-based models to the standard economic approach to crises and shows the ways in which agent-based models overcome limitations of economic models when dealing with financial crises. In particular, this article demonstrates how agent-based models replace homogeneous, representative agents with heterogeneous agents and optimization with heuristics, and how such models move away from a focus on equilibrium, allowing non-ergodic dynamics that are manifest during financial crises to emerge. © Copyright 2017 by Annual Reviews.

It needs to consider characteristics of heterogeneity, interactivity, adaptability, and emergence as per complex adaptive systems. Agent-based Modeling (ABM) can take into account the heterogeneity of system elements, adaptability of subject behavior, and environment’s dynamic evolution characteristics, which help analyzing complex, dynamic, and nonlinear green development problems. Hence, this paper intends to systemically review the research literature on the ABM method for green development. The review found many new advantages and some shortcomings when using the ABM method in various fields, namely, green market and consumption, green supply chain, green technology, green layout, and other development in green aspect. The review findings contribute into clarifying the applications of the ABM method for green development from a panoramic view. They also render some improvement methods in addressing the current research issues and managerial actions for the applications of the ABM method for green development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.",Agent-based modeling; Bibliometric analysis; Green development; Literature review; Sustainable,,,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71971100, 72071096, 72101055); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Philosophy and Social Sciences Excellent Innovation Team Construction foundation of Jiangsu province, (SSZ2020-20)","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71971100, 72071096, 72101055); Philosophy and Social Sciences Excellent Innovation Team Construction foundation of Jiangsu province (No. SSZ2020-20).

This literature uses both System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-Based models (ABMs). SD models offer a macro perspective with differential equations and graphical representations, while ABMs provide a micro perspective on individual agents’ behaviors. These models are complementary: SD models set exogenous conditions for ABMs, aiding their development and validation, while ABMs offer data to validate SD structures by capturing emergent behaviors. Integrating Agent-Based and SD (ABSD) models leverages their strengths, offering a more nuanced analysis of sustainable development despite challenges like complexity and computational demands. We then propose a guideline to address these limitations and two potential applications to provide a detailed analysis of ABSD models in global sustainable development. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",ABSD models; Complex systems; Hybrid methodology; Sustainability,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Differential equations; Simulation platform; System theory; Agent based; Agent-based and SD model; Agent-based model; Hybrid methodologies; Integrating systems; Multidimensional framework; Non linear; System agents; System Dynamics; System dynamics modelling; Sustainable development,,,,,"Stefano Tedeschi, (B53D23010030008)",We thank Stefano Tedeschi and the two anonymous referees for their valuable feedback.

Lebedev Physical Institute, Moscow, Russian Federation","COVID-19 pandemic challenges the sustainability of the modern financial system. International central bankers claim that banks are solid. They have accumulated significant capital buffers. Those buffers should be further more augmented by 2027 in line with Basel III reforms. However, disregarding such a consecutive rise in the banking capital adequacy requirements, the US financial authorities undertook an unprecedented step. First time in the country history they lowered the reserve requirement to zero at the end of March 2020. Friedrich von Hayek demonstrated the fragility of the modern fractional reserve banking systems. Together with Ludwig von Mises (von Mises, 1978) he was thus able to predict the Great Depression of 1929 and explain its mechanics much in advance. Thus, we wish to utilize the agent-based modeling technique to extend von Hayek's rationale to the previously unstudied interaction of capital adequacy and reserve requirement regulation. We find that the full reserve requirement regime even without capital adequacy regulation provides more stable financial environment than the existing one. Rise in capital adequacy adds to modern banking sustainability, but it still preserves the system remarkably fragile compared to the full reserve requirement. We also prove that capital adequacy regulation is redundant when the latter environment is in place. We discuss our findings application to the potential Central Bank Digital Currencies regulation.  © 2021-IOS Press.
