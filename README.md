## Abstract
This repository presents a comprehensive systematic review of agent-based modeling (ABM) applications in sustainable finance (SF). Our analysis reveals a critical validation gap, with 93% of studies relying on single validation methods, which undermines model credibility for policy applications. Additionally, we identify poor regulatory alignment, finding that 49% of studies remain unclassified relative to EU taxonomy categories, indicating a significant disconnect from current regulatory frameworks.

## Review Overview
This repository contains the complete data (raw search results from databases, screened papers, and final coded literature dataset), all coding, analysis, and visualization materials for complete transparency and reproducibility of our SLR process on ABM applications in SF. The review synthesizes findings from 45 papers published between 2005 and 2025.

## Research Questions

- RQ1: What are the main application areas and sustainability dimensions most commonly modeled in sustainable finance using ABM, and how are these distributed across the EU taxonomy categories?
- RQ2: What modeling approaches do these ABM studies employ (agent designs, interaction mechanisms, and validation methods)?
- RQ3: What are the current limitations and the most promising avenues for future ABM research in sustainable finance?

## Review Methodology

- Search Strategy: Systematic search across Web of Science & Scopus
- Inclusion Criteria: ABM studies with sustainable finance applications
- Analysis Framework: Systematic coding of application areas, EU taxonomy alignment, agent methodologies, and validation approaches
- Papers Reviewed: 45 papers after systematic screening process
